The cat ( Felis catus ), also called domestic cat and house cat , is a small carnivorous mammal. It is an obligate carnivore , requiring a predominantly meat-based diet. Its retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey species such as mice and rats . It has a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes , and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social species , but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator . Cat communication includes meowing , purring , trilling, hissing , growling , grunting , and body language . It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals . It secretes and perceives pheromones . Cat intelligence is evident in its ability to adapt, learn through observation, and solve problems. 
Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn in temperate zones and throughout the year in equatorial regions , with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. 

The domestic cat is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae . Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat started in the Near East around 7500 BCE . Today, the domestic cat occurs across the globe and is valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin . It is commonly kept as a pet , working cat , and pedigreed cat shown at cat fancy events. Out of the estimated 600 million domestic cats worldwide, 400 million reside in Asia , including 58 million in China . The United States leads in cat ownership with 73.8 million cats, followed by the United Kingdom with approximately 10.9 million cats. It also ranges freely as a feral cat , avoiding human contact. Pet abandonment contributes to increasing of the global feral cat population, which has driven the decline of bird , mammal , and reptile species. Population control includes spaying and neutering . 

# Etymology and naming 

The origin of the English word cat , Old English catt , is thought to be the Late Latin word cattus , which was first used at the beginning of the 6th century. [ 4 ] The Late Latin word may be derived from an unidentified African language . [ 5 ] The Nubian word kaddîska 'wildcat' and Nobiin kadīs are possible sources or cognates. [ 6 ] 

The forms might also have derived from an ancient Germanic word that was absorbed into Latin and then into Greek, Syriac, and Arabic. [ 7 ] The word may be derived from Germanic and Northern European languages, and ultimately be borrowed from Uralic , cf. Northern Sámi gáđfi 'female stoat ', and Hungarian hölgy 'lady, female stoat'; from Proto-Uralic * käďwä 'female (of a furred animal)'. [ 8 ] 

The English puss , extended as pussy and pussycat , is attested from the 16th century and may have been introduced from Dutch poes or from Low German puuskatte , related to Swedish kattepus , or Norwegian pus , pusekatt . Similar forms exist in Lithuanian puižė and Irish puisín or puiscín . The etymology is unknown, but it may be an onomatopoeia from using a sound to attract a cat. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] 

A male cat is called a tom , tommy or tomcat [ 11 ] (or a gib , [ 12 ] if neutered ). A female is called a queen (or sometimes a molly , [ 13 ] if spayed ). [ 14 ] Some sources write that queen refers solely to unspayed cats that are in an estrous cycle . [ 15 ] A juvenile cat is referred to as a kitten (shortened to kitty in British English [ 16 ] ), a term interchangeable with the now-obsolete word catling in Early Modern English . [ 17 ] A group of cats can be referred to as a clowder , a glaring , [ 18 ] or a colony . [ 19 ] 

# Taxonomy 

The scientific name Felis catus was proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 for a domestic cat. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Felis catus domesticus was proposed by Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben in 1777. [ 3 ] Felis daemon proposed by Konstantin Satunin in 1904 was a black cat from the Transcaucasus , later identified as a domestic cat. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] 

In 2003, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature conserved the name silvestris Erxleben 1777 for the wildcat , but did not suppress catus Linnaeus 1758. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] In 2007, the modern domesticated subspecies F. silvestris catus was sampled worldwide and considered to have probably descended from the African wildcat ( F. lybica ), following results of phylogenetic research. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ a ] In 2017, the IUCN Cat Classification Taskforce, following the recommendation of Gentry et al. (2004) [ 23 ] that names based on domestic forms be used for domestic derivatives of wild species, regarded the domestic cat as a distinct species, Felis catus . [ 26 ] 

# Evolution 

Main article: Cat evolution 
Skulls of a wildcat (top left), a housecat (top right), and a hybrid between the two (bottom center) 

The domestic cat is a member of the Felidae, a family that has a common ancestor from about 10 to 15 million years ago . [ 27 ] The evolutionary radiation of the Felidae began in Asia during the Miocene around 8.38 to 14.45 million years ago . [ 28 ] Analysis of mitochondrial DNA of all Felidae species indicates a radiation at 6.46 to 16.76 million years ago . [ 29 ] The genus Felis genetically diverged from other Felidae around 6 to 7 million years ago . [ 28 ] Results of phylogenetic research shows that the wild members of this genus evolved through sympatric or parapatric speciation , whereas the domestic cat evolved through artificial selection . [ 30 ] The domestic cat and its closest wild ancestor are diploid and both possess 38 chromosomes [ 31 ] and roughly 20,000 genes. [ 32 ]

# Domestication 

See also: Domestication of the cat and Cats in ancient Egypt 
A cat eats a fish under a chair, in a mural in an Egyptian tomb dating to the 15th century BCE. 

It was long thought that the domestication of the cat began in ancient Egypt , where cats were venerated from around 3100 BCE . [ 34 ] [ 35 ] However, the earliest known indication for the taming of an African wildcat was excavated close by a human Neolithic grave in Shillourokambos , southern Cyprus , dating to about 7500–7200 BCE. Since there is no evidence of native mammalian fauna on Cyprus, the inhabitants of this Neolithic village most likely brought the cat and other wild mammals to the island from the Middle Eastern mainland. [ 36 ] Scientists therefore assume that African wildcats were attracted to early human settlements in the Fertile Crescent by rodents, in particular the house mouse ( Mus musculus ), and were tamed by Neolithic farmers. This mutual relationship between early farmers and tamed cats lasted thousands of years. As agricultural practices spread, so did tame and domesticated cats. [ 33 ] [ 37 ] Wildcats of Egypt contributed to the maternal gene pool of the domestic cat at a later time. [ 38 ] 

The earliest known evidence for the occurrence of the domestic cat in Greece dates to around 1200 BCE. Greek, Phoenician , Carthaginian and Etruscan traders introduced it to southern Europe. [ 39 ] By the 5th century BCE, it was a familiar animal around settlements in Magna Graecia and Etruria . [ 40 ] During the Roman Empire , it was introduced to Corsica and Sardinia . [ 41 ] By the end of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, the Egyptian domestic cat lineage had arrived in a Baltic Sea port in northern Germany . [ 38 ] 

The leopard cat ( Prionailurus bengalensis ) was tamed independently in China around 5500 BCE. This line of a partially domesticated cat left no trace in the domestic cat populations of today. [ 42 ] 

During domestication, cats have undergone only minor changes in anatomy and behavior, and they are still capable of surviving in the wild. Several natural behaviors and characteristics of wildcats may have pre-adapted them for domestication as pets. These traits include their small size, social nature, obvious body language, love of play, and high intelligence. Their rigorous grooming habits and instinct to bury their bodily waste make them generally much less messy than other domesticated animals. Captive Leopardus cats may also display affectionate behavior toward humans but are not domesticated. [ 43 ] House cats may mate with feral cats. [ 44 ] 

The development of cat breeds started in the mid 19th century. [ 45 ] An analysis of the domestic cat genome revealed that the ancestral wildcat genome was significantly altered in the process of domestication, as specific mutations were selected to develop cat breeds. [ 46 ] Most breeds are founded on random-bred domestic cats. Genetic diversity of these breeds varies between regions, and is lowest in purebred populations, which show more than 20 deleterious genetic disorders . [ 47 ] Hybridization between domestic and other Felinae species is also possible, producing hybrids such as the Kellas cat in Scotland . [ 48 ] [ 49 ] 

# Characteristics 

Main article: Cat anatomy 

# Size 

Diagram of the general anatomy of a male domestic cat 

The domestic cat has a smaller skull and shorter bones than the European wildcat . [ 50 ] It averages about 46 cm (18 in) in head-to-body length and 23–25 cm (9.1–9.8 in) in height, with about 30 cm (12 in) long tails. Males are larger than females. [ 51 ] Adult domestic cats typically weigh 4–5 kg (8.8–11.0 lb). [ 30 ] 

# Skeleton 

Cats have seven cervical vertebrae (as do most mammals ); 13 thoracic vertebrae (humans have 12); seven lumbar vertebrae (humans have five); three sacral vertebrae (as do most mammals, but humans have five); and a variable number of caudal vertebrae in the tail (humans have only three to five vestigial caudal vertebrae, fused into an internal coccyx ). [ 52 ] : 11 The extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the cat's spinal mobility and flexibility. Attached to the spine are 13 ribs, the shoulder, and the pelvis . [ 52 ] : 16 Unlike human arms, cat forelimbs are attached to the shoulder by free-floating clavicle bones which allow them to pass their body through any space into which they can fit their head. [ 53 ] 

# Skull 

Cat skull 

The cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large eye sockets and a powerful specialized jaw. [ 54 ] : 35 Two long canine teeth for killing and tearing prey, can stab between two of the prey's vertebrae and sever its spinal cord , causing paralysis and death. [ 55 ] Compared to other felines, domestic cats have narrowly spaced canine teeth relative to the size of their jaw, which is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodents, which have small vertebrae. [ 55 ] 

The premolar and first molar together compose the carnassial pair on each side of the mouth, which efficiently shears meat into small pieces, like a pair of scissors. These are vital in feeding, because cats' small molars cannot chew food effectively, and cats are largely incapable of mastication. [ 54 ] : 37 Cats tend to have better dental health than most humans, with decay generally less likely because of a thicker protective layer of enamel , a less damaging saliva, less retention of food particles between teeth, and a diet mostly devoid of sugar. Nonetheless, they are subject to occasional tooth loss and infection. [ 56 ] 

# Claws 

Cat's claw 

Cats have protractible and retractable claws. [ 57 ] In their normal, relaxed position, the claws are sheathed with the skin and fur around the paw's toe pads. This keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the ground and allows for the silent stalking of prey. The claws on the forefeet are typically sharper than those on the hindfeet. [ 58 ] Cats can voluntarily extend their claws, such as in hunting, fighting, climbing, kneading , or for extra traction on soft surfaces. Cats shed the outside layer of their claw sheaths when scratching rough surfaces. [ 59 ] 

Most cats have five claws on their front paws and four on their rear paws. The dewclaw is proximal to the other claws. More proximally is a protrusion which appears to be a sixth "finger". This special feature of the front paws on the inside of the wrists has no function in normal walking but is thought to be an antiskidding device used while jumping. Some cat breeds are prone to having extra digits (" polydactyly "). [ 60 ] 

# Ambulation 

The cat is digitigrade . It walks on the toes, with the bones of the feet making up the lower part of the visible leg. [ 61 ] Unlike most mammals, it uses a "pacing" gait that alternates both legs together on each side. It registers directly by placing each hind paw close to the track of the corresponding fore paw, minimizing noise and visible tracks. This also provides sure footing for hind paws when navigating rough terrain. As it speeds up from walking to trotting, its gait changes to a "diagonal" gait: The diagonally opposite hind and fore legs move simultaneously. [ 62 ] 

# Balance 

A cat is perched on a tree branch, having climbed up for exploration, escape, or hunting. 

Cats are generally fond of perching in high places. This may be a concealed hunting site such as a tree branch, for domestic cats to pounce upon prey. They favor a superior observation point over territory. A cat falling from up to 3 m (9.8 ft) can right itself and land on its paws. [ 63 ] 

During a lofty fall, a cat reflexively twists and rights itself to land on its feet using its acute sense of balance and flexibility. This reflex is known as the cat righting reflex . [ 64 ] A cat always rights itself in the same way, and it has enough time in falls of at least 90 cm (3.0 ft). [ 65 ] This has been investigated as the " falling cat problem ". [ 66 ] 

# Coats 

Main article: Cat coat genetics 

See also: Tabby cat 
Mother cat with her different-colored offspring 

The cat family (Felidae) can pass down many colors and patterns to their offspring. The domestic cat genes MC1R and ASIP allow color variety in their coats. The feline ASIP gene consists of three coding exons. [ 67 ] Three novel microsatellite markers linked to ASIP were isolated from a domestic cat BAC clone containing this gene to perform linkage analysis on 89 domestic cats segregated for melanism . The domestic cat family demonstrated a cosegregation between the ASIP allele and coat black coloration. [ 68 ] 

# Senses 

Main article: Cat senses 

# Vision 

A cat's nictitating membrane is exposed as it blinks. 

Cats have excellent night vision and can see at one sixth the light level required for human vision. [ 54 ] : 43 This is partly the result of cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum , which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light. [ 69 ] Large pupils are an adaptation to dim light. The domestic cat has slit pupils , which allow it to focus bright light without chromatic aberration . [ 70 ] At low light, a cat's pupils expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes. [ 71 ] The domestic cat has rather poor color vision and only two types of cone cells , optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; its ability to distinguish between red and green is limited. [ 72 ] A response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the rod cells might be due to a third type of cone. This appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather than representing true trichromatic vision. [ 73 ] Cats have a nictitating membrane , allowing them to blink without hindering their vision. 

# Hearing 

The domestic cat's hearing is most acute in the range of 500 Hz to 32 kHz. [ 74 ] It can detect an extremely broad range of frequencies ranging from 55 Hz to 79 kHz, whereas humans can only detect frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz. It can hear a range of 10.5 octaves , compared to about 9 octaves for humans and dogs. [ 75 ] [ 76 ] Its hearing sensitivity is enhanced by its large movable outer ears, the pinnae , which amplify sounds and help detect the location of a noise. It can detect ultrasound , including ultrasonic calls from rodent prey. [ 77 ] [ 78 ] Research has shown that cats have socio-spatial cognitive abilities to create mental maps of familiar people's locations based on hearing their voices. [ 79 ] 

# Smell 

Cats have an acute sense of smell, due in part to their well-developed olfactory bulb and a large surface of olfactory mucosa , about 5.8 cm 2 (0.90 in 2 ) in area, which is about twice that of humans. [ 80 ] Cats and many other animals have a Jacobson's organ in their mouths that is used in the behavioral process of flehmening . It allows them to sense certain aromas in a way that humans cannot. Cats are sensitive to pheromones such as 3-mercapto-3-methylbutan-1-ol , [ 81 ] which they use to communicate through urine spraying and marking with scent glands . [ 82 ] Many cats also respond strongly to plants that contain nepetalactone , especially catnip , which they can detect at less than one part per billion. [ 83 ] About 70–80% of cats are affected by nepetalactone. [ 84 ] This response is also produced by other plants, such as silver vine ( Actinidia polygama ) and the herb valerian ; it may be caused by the smell of these plants mimicking a pheromone and stimulating cats' social or sexual behaviors. [ 85 ] 

# Taste 

Cats have about 470 taste buds , compared to more than 9,000 on the human tongue. [ 86 ] Domestic and wild cats share a taste receptor gene mutation that keeps their sweet taste buds from binding to sugary molecules, leaving them with no ability to taste sweetness . [ 87 ] But they do have taste bud receptors specialized for acids , amino acids such as the constituents of protein, and bitter tastes. [ 88 ] 

Cats' taste buds possess the receptors needed to detect umami . However, these receptors contain molecular changes that make them taste umami differently from humans. In humans, they detect the amino acids glutamic acid and aspartic acid ; but in cats, they instead detect inosine monophosphate and histidine . [ 89 ] These molecules are particularly enriched in tuna . [ 89 ] Researchers argue why cats find tuna so palatable : "the specific combination of the high IMP and free histidine contents of tuna, which produces a strong umami taste synergy that is highly preferred by cats." [ 89 ] One researcher said, "I think umami is as important for cats as sweet is for humans." [ 90 ] 

Cats distinctly prefer food temperature around 38 °C (100 °F), similar to a fresh kill. Some cats reject cold food, which would signal to the cat that the prey is long dead and therefore possibly toxic or decomposing. [ 86 ] 

# Whiskers 

The whiskers of a cat are highly sensitive to touch. 

To aid with navigation and sensation, cats have dozens of movable whiskers (vibrissae) over their body, especially their faces. These provide information on the width of gaps and on the location of objects in the dark, both by touching objects directly and by sensing air currents. They trigger protective blink reflexes to protect the eyes from damage. [ 54 ] : 47 

# Behavior 

See also: Cat behavior 

Outdoor cats are active both day and night, although they tend to be slightly more active at night. [ 91 ] Domestic cats spend the majority of their time in the vicinity of their homes, but they can range a radius of many hundreds of meters. They establish territories that vary considerably in size, in one study ranging 7–28 ha (17–69 acres). [ 92 ] The timing of cats' activity is quite flexible and varied; but being low-light predators, they are generally crepuscular , which means they tend to be more active near dawn and dusk. However, house cats' behavior is also influenced by human activity, and they may adapt to their owners' sleeping patterns to some extent. [ 93 ] [ 94 ] 

Cats conserve energy by sleeping more than most animals, especially as they grow older. The daily duration of sleep varies, usually between 12 and 16 hours, with 13 to 14 being the average. Some cats can sleep as much as 20 hours. The term "cat nap" for a short rest refers to the cat's tendency to fall asleep (lightly) for a brief period. Short periods of rapid eye movement sleep are often accompanied by muscle twitches, which suggests they are dreaming. [ 95 ] 

Behavioral and personality traits depend on a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Scientific evidence is mixed about the popular belief that those traits are linked to coat colors. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] [ 98 ] 

# Sociability 

The social behavior of the domestic cat ranges from widely dispersed individuals to feral cat colonies that gather around a food source, based on groups of co-operating females. [ 99 ] [ 100 ] Within such groups, one cat is usually dominant over the others. [ 101 ] Each cat in a colony holds a distinct territory, with sexually active males having the largest territories, which are about 10 times larger than those of female cats and may overlap with several females' territories. These territories are marked by urine spraying , rubbing objects at head height with secretions from facial glands, and by defecation . [ 82 ] Between these territories are neutral areas where cats watch and greet one another without territorial conflicts. Outside these neutral areas, territory holders usually chase away stranger cats, at first by staring, hissing, and growling , and, if that does not work, by short and violent, noisy attacks. Because cats do not have a social survival strategy or herd behavior , they always hunt alone. [ 102 ] 
Two kittens lying side by side, an instinctive behavior that offers both comfort and protection 

Life in proximity to humans and other domestic animals has led to a symbiotic social adaptation in cats, and cats may express great affection toward humans or other animals. Ethologically , a cat's human keeper functions as a mother surrogate. [ 103 ] Adult cats live in a type of extended kittenhood, a form of behavioral neoteny . Their high-pitched sounds may mimic the cries of a hungry human infant, making them particularly difficult for humans to ignore. [ 104 ] Some pet cats are poorly socialized. In particular, older cats may show aggressiveness toward newly arrived kittens, which includes biting and scratching; this type of behavior is known as feline asocial aggression. [ 105 ] 

Redirected aggression is a common form of aggression that can occur in multiple cat households. In redirected aggression, a cat is usually agitated by a stimulus such as a sight, sound, or other trigger that causes heightened anxiety or arousal; if the cat cannot attack the original stimulus, it may redirect its aggression toward the nearest cat, pet, human, or other being. [ 106 ] [ 107 ] 

Domestic cats' scent rubbing behavior toward humans or other cats is thought to be a feline means of social bonding. [ 108 ] 

# Communication 

Main article: Cat communication 

Vocalizing domestic cat 

A meow 

Domestic cats use many vocalizations for communication, including purring , trilling , hissing, growling/snarling, grunting, and several different forms of meowing. [ 109 ] Their body language , including position of ears and tail, relaxation of the whole body, and kneading of the paws, are all indicators of mood. The tail and ears are particularly important social signal mechanisms; a raised tail indicates a friendly greeting, and flattened ears indicate hostility. Tail-raising also indicates the cat's position in the group's social hierarchy , with dominant individuals raising their tails less often than subordinate ones. [ 110 ] Feral cats are generally silent. [ 111 ] : 208 Nose-to-nose touching is also a common greeting and may be followed by social grooming , which is solicited by one of the cats raising and tilting its head. [ 99 ] 

Purring may have developed as an evolutionary advantage as a signaling mechanism of reassurance between mother cats and nursing kittens, who are thought to use it as a care-soliciting signal. [ 112 ] Post-nursing cats also often purr as a sign of contentment: when being petted, becoming relaxed, [ 113 ] [ 114 ] or eating. Although purring is popularly interpreted as indicative of pleasure, it has been recorded in a wide variety of circumstances, most of which involve physical contact between the cat and another, presumably trusted individual. [ 112 ] Some cats have been observed to purr continuously when chronically ill or in apparent pain. [ 115 ] 

The exact mechanism by which cats purr has long been elusive, but it has been proposed that purring is generated via a series of sudden build-ups and releases of pressure as the glottis is opened and closed, which causes the vocal folds to separate forcefully. The laryngeal muscles in control of the glottis are thought to be driven by a neural oscillator which generates a cycle of contraction and release every 30–40 milliseconds (giving a frequency of 33 to 25 Hz). [ 112 ] [ 116 ] [ 117 ] 

Domestic cats observed in rescue facilities have 276 morphologically distinct facial expressions based on 26 facial movements; each facial expression corresponds to different social functions that are probably influenced by domestication. [ 118 ] Facial expressions have helped researchers detect pain in cats. The feline grimace scale 's five criteria—ear position, orbital tightening, muzzle tension, whisker change, and head position—indicated the presence of acute pain in cats. [ 119 ] [ 120 ] 

# Grooming 

Cat tongue 

Cats are known for spending considerable amounts of time licking their coats to keep them clean. [ 121 ] [ 122 ] The cat's tongue has backward-facing spines about 0.5 millimeter long, called lingual papillae , which contain keratin making them rigid. [ 123 ] The papillae act like a hairbrush, and some cats, particularly long-haired cats , occasionally regurgitate sausage-shaped 2–3 cm (0.8–1.2 in) long hairballs of fur that have collected in their stomachs from grooming. Hairballs can be prevented with remedies that ease elimination of the hair through the gut , and regular grooming of the coat with a comb or stiff brush. [ 121 ] 

# Cat intelligence 

Main article: Cat intelligence 
A cat uses problem-solving skills to open a door. 

Cat intelligence refers to a cat's ability to solve problems, adapt to its environment, learn new behaviors, and communicate its needs. Structurally, a cat's brain shares similarities with the human brain, [ 124 ] containing around 250 million neurons in the cerebral cortex, which is responsible for complex processing. [ 125 ] Cats display neuroplasticity allowing their brains to reorganize based on experiences. They have well-developed memory retaining information for a decade or longer. These memories are often intertwined with emotions, allowing cats to recall both positive and negative experiences associated with specific places. [ 126 ] While they excel in observational learning and problem-solving, studies conclude that they struggle with understanding cause-and-effect relationships in the same way that humans do. [ 127 ] 

Cat intelligence study is mostly from consideration of the domesticated cat. Living in urban environments has exposed them to challenges that require adaptive behaviors, contributing to cognitive development. [ 128 ] Selective breeding and genetic changes have further influenced their intelligence. [ 129 ] [ 130 ] Kittens learn essential survival skills by observing their mothers, while adult cats refine their abilities through trial and error . [ citation needed ] 

# Play 

Main article: Cat play and toys 
Kittens aged 14 weeks use fighting as a form of play. 

Domestic cats, especially young kittens, are known for their love of play. This behavior mimics hunting and is important in helping kittens learn to stalk, capture, and kill prey. [ 131 ] Cats also engage in play fighting , both with each other and with humans. This behavior may be a way for cats to practice the skills needed for real combat, and it might also reduce the fear that they associate with launching attacks on other animals. [ 132 ] 

Cats also tend to play with toys more when they are hungry. [ 133 ] Owing to the close similarity between play and hunting, cats prefer to play with objects that resemble prey, such as small furry toys that move rapidly, but rapidly lose interest. They become habituated to a toy they have played with before. [ 134 ] String is often used as a toy, but if it is eaten, it can become caught at the base of the cat's tongue and then move into the intestines , a medical emergency which can cause serious illness, even death. [ 135 ] 

# Hunting and feeding 

See also: Cat food 
A deermouse is the prey of this domestic cat. 

The shape and structure of cats' cheeks is insufficient to allow them to take in liquids using suction. Lapping at a rate of four times a second, the cat touches the smooth tip of its tongue to the surface of the water, and quickly retracts it like a corkscrew, drawing water upward into their mouths. [ 136 ] [ 137 ] 

Feral cats and free-fed house cats consume several small meals in a day. The frequency and size of meals varies between individuals. They select food based on its temperature, smell, and texture; they dislike chilled foods and respond most strongly to moist foods rich in amino acids, which are similar to meat. Cats reject novel flavors (a response termed neophobia ) and learn quickly to avoid foods that have tasted unpleasant in the past. [ 102 ] [ 138 ] It is also a common misconception that all cats like milk or cream, as they tend to avoid sweet food and milk. Most adult cats are lactose intolerant ; the sugar in milk is not easily digested and may cause soft stools or diarrhea . [ 139 ] Some also develop odd eating habits and like to eat or chew on things such as wool, plastic, cables, paper, string, aluminum foil, or even coal. This condition, pica , can threaten their health, depending on the amount and toxicity of the items eaten. [ 140 ] 

Cats hunt small prey, primarily birds and rodents, [ 141 ] and are often used as a form of pest control. [ 142 ] [ 143 ] Other common small creatures, such as lizards and snakes, may also become prey. [ 144 ] Cats use two hunting strategies, either stalking prey actively, or waiting in ambush until an animal comes close enough to be captured. [ 145 ] The strategy used depends on available prey, with cats waiting in ambush outside burrows, but tending to actively stalk birds. [ 146 ] : 153 Domestic cats are a major predator of wildlife in the United States, killing an estimated 1.3 to 4.0 billion birds and 6.3 to 22.3 billion mammals annually. [ 147 ] 

Certain species appear more susceptible than others; in one English village, for example, 30% of house sparrow mortality was linked to the domestic cat. [ 148 ] In the recovery of ringed robins ( Erithacus rubecula ) and dunnocks ( Prunella modularis ) in Britain, 31% of deaths were a result of cat predation. [ 149 ] In parts of North America, the presence of larger carnivores such as coyotes , which prey on cats and other small predators, reduces the effect of predation by cats and other small predators such as opossums and raccoons on bird numbers and variety. [ 150 ] 

Another poorly understood element of cat hunting behavior is the presentation of prey to human guardians. One explanation is that cats adopt humans into their social group and share excess kill with others in the group according to the dominance hierarchy , in which humans are reacted to as if they are at or near the top. [ 151 ] Another explanation is that they attempt to teach their guardians to hunt or to help their human as if feeding "an elderly cat, or an inept kitten". [ 152 ] This hypothesis is inconsistent with the fact that male cats also bring home prey, though males have negligible involvement in raising kittens. [ 146 ] : 153 

# Fighting 

This domestic cat hisses and arches its back. 

Domestic males are more likely to fight than females. [ 153 ] The most common reason for feral cat fighting is competition between two males to mate with a female, and most fights are won by the heavier male. [ 154 ] Another common reason for fighting in domestic cats is the difficulty of establishing territories within a small home. [ 153 ] Female cats also fight over territory or to defend their kittens. Neutering decreases or eliminates this behavior in many cases, suggesting that the behavior is linked to sex hormones . [ 155 ] 

When cats become aggressive, they try to appear larger and more threatening by raising their fur, arching their backs, turning sideways, hissing, or spitting. [ 156 ] Often, the ears are pointed down and back to avoid damage to the inner ear and potentially listen for any changes behind them while focused forward. Cats may also vocalize loudly and bare their teeth in an effort to further intimidate their opponents. Fights usually consist of grappling, slapping the face and body with the forepaws, and bites. Cats throw themselves to the ground in a defensive posture to rake their opponent's belly with their hind legs. [ 157 ] 

Serious damage is rare, because the fights are usually short, with the loser fleeing with scratches to the face and ears. More severe fights for mating rights may give deep punctures and lacerations. Normally, serious injuries from fighting are limited to infections from scratches and bites. Bites are probably the main route of transmission of the feline immunodeficiency virus . [ 158 ] Sexually active males are usually involved in many fights and have battered faces. [ 159 ] Cats are willing to threaten animals larger than them to defend their territory, such as dogs and foxes . [ 160 ] 

# Reproduction 

See also: Kitten 
When cats mate, the tomcat (male) bites the scruff of the female's neck as she assumes a position conducive to mating known as lordosis behavior . 

The cat secretes and perceives pheromones . [ 161 ] Female cats, called queens , are polyestrous with several estrus cycles during a year, lasting usually 21 days. They are usually ready to mate between early February and August [ 162 ] in northern temperate zones and throughout the year in equatorial regions. [ 163 ] 

Several males, called tomcats, are attracted to a female in heat. They fight over her, and the victor wins the right to mate. At first, the female rejects the male, but eventually, the female allows the male to mate. The female utters a loud yowl as the male pulls out of her because a male cat's penis has a band of about 120–150 backward-pointing penile spines , which are about 1 mm (0.04 in) long; upon withdrawal of the penis, the spines may provide the female with increased sexual stimulation, which acts to induce ovulation . [ 164 ] 
In this radiography of a pregnant cat, the skeletons of two fetuses are on the left and right of the uterus. 

After mating, the female cleans her vulva thoroughly. If a male attempts to mate with her at this point, the female attacks him. After about 20 to 30 minutes, once the female is finished grooming, the cycle will repeat. [ 165 ] Because ovulation is not always triggered by a single mating, females may not be impregnated by the first male with which they mate. [ 166 ] Furthermore, cats are superfecund ; that is, a female may mate with more than one male when she is in heat, with the result that different kittens in a litter may have different fathers. [ 165 ] 

The morula forms 124 hours after conception. At 148 hours, early blastocysts form. At 10–12 days, implantation occurs. [ 167 ] The gestation of queens lasts between 64 and 67 days, with an average of 65 days. [ 162 ] [ 168 ] 
Two 17-day-old kittens 

Based on a study of 2,300 free-ranging queens conducted from May 1998 and October 2000, they had one to six kittens per litter , with an average of three kittens. They produced a mean of 1.4 litters per year, but a maximum of three litters in a year. Of 169 kittens, 127 died before they were six months old due to a trauma caused in most cases by dog attacks and road accidents. [ 169 ] The first litter is usually smaller than subsequent litters. Kittens are weaned between six and seven weeks of age. Queens normally reach sexual maturity at 5–10 months, and males at 5–7 months. This varies depending on breed. [ 165 ] Kittens reach puberty at the age of 9–10 months. [ 162 ] 

Cats are ready to go to new homes at about 12 weeks of age, when they are ready to leave their mother. [ 170 ] They can be surgically sterilized (spayed or castrated ) as early as seven weeks to limit unwanted reproduction. [ 171 ] This surgery also prevents undesirable sex-related behavior, such as aggression, territory marking (spraying urine) in males, and yowling (calling) in females. Traditionally, this surgery was performed at around six to nine months of age, but it is increasingly being performed before puberty , at about three to six months. [ 172 ] In the United States, about 80% of household cats are neutered. [ 173 ] 

# Lifespan and health 

Main articles: Cat health and Aging in cats 

The average lifespan of pet cats has risen in recent decades. In the early 1980s, it was about 7 years, [ 174 ] : 33 [ 175 ] rising to 9.4 years in 1995 [ 174 ] : 33 and an average of about 13 years as of 2014 and 2023. [ 176 ] [ 177 ] 

Neutering increases life expectancy; one study found castrated male cats live twice as long as intact males, while spayed female cats live 62% longer than intact females. [ 174 ] : 35 Having a cat neutered confers some health benefits, such as a greater life expectancy and a decreased incidence of reproductive neoplasia . [ 178 ] However, neutering decreases metabolism [ 179 ] [ 180 ] [ 181 ] and increases food intake, [ 181 ] [ 182 ] both of which can cause obesity in neutered cats. [ 183 ] Pre-pubertal neutering (neutering at 4 months or earlier) was only recommended by 28% of American veterinarians in one study. Some concerns of early neutering were metabolic, retarded physeal closure , and urinary tract disease related. [ 184 ] 

# Disease 

Main article: List of feline diseases 

About 250 heritable genetic disorders have been identified in cats; many are similar to human inborn errors of metabolism . [ 185 ] The high level of similarity among the metabolism of mammals allows many of these feline diseases to be diagnosed using genetic tests that were originally developed for use in humans, as well as the use of cats as animal models in the study of the human diseases. [ 186 ] [ 187 ] Diseases affecting domestic cats include acute infections, parasitic infestations , injuries, and chronic diseases such as kidney disease , thyroid disease , and arthritis . Vaccinations are available for many infectious diseases, as are treatments to eliminate parasites such as worms, ticks, and fleas. [ 188 ] 

# Cat care and welfare 

It has been found that cat owners' knowledge affects how they care for their cats. For example, people with greater knowledge about cats are less likely to use positive punishment (i.e., causing an unpleasant stimulus to the cat). [ 189 ] 

Accidental poisoning in cats is common and can result from several sources: plants that are toxic to cats, medications not intended for cats, foods unsuitable for cats, and household substances such as pesticides and paint thinners. [ 190 ] Plants toxic to cats include lilies , Tulip , and Philodendron . Medication poisoning occurs when cats ingest drugs intended for human use but toxic to cats, such as acetaminophen and aspirin , as well as vitamin capsules formulated for humans or certain flea treatments designed for dogs (cats should be kept away from a dog treated with these products for 24 hours). Foods dangerous to cats include grapes , onions , garlic , and chocolate . [ 190 ] 

Many professional organizations have published guidelines for the proper and safe care of cats. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) has published a general guide emphasizing proper cat care. [ 191 ] The guide covers appropriate nutrition , fresh and clean water changed daily, routine grooming including brushing the coat , regular and odor-free litter box maintenance, and regular veterinary care, recommending that cats undergo a routine veterinary check-up at least once a year. In addition to the general guide, there are specific guides for proper grooming, [ 192 ] common feline diseases, [ 193 ] and behavioral issues. [ 194 ] 

The American Association of Feline Practitioners (AAFP) and the International Society of Feline Medicine (ISFM) released a guide on the environmental needs of cats. [ 195 ] The guide focuses on five main aspects: providing a safe private space for the cat (e.g., a cardboard box on its side, placed in a high location, and in sufficient numbers if multiple cats are present); offering multiple environmental resources (several feeding stations, resting areas and litter boxes, and separating food from water); opportunities for play and activities that simulate hunting behavior (using appropriate toys and puzzle feeders); positive, consistent, and predictable social interaction (acclimating the cat to frequent contact from an early age, speaking softly, and avoiding forced contact); and an environment that allows the cat to use its sense of smell normally (providing scratching posts and other items where it can leave its scent , and avoiding strong odors throughout the home). 

Various professional organizations have emphasized the importance of environmental enrichment for cats, [ 195 ] and some studies have raised concerns that many cat owners do not provide sufficient environmental enrichment. In an online survey of cat owners, only about half of the respondents reported playing with their cats daily. [ 189 ] 

Between 50% and 90% of cats will experience dental or gum problems, but these can be prevented by maintaining the cat's oral hygiene using products specifically designed for cats (products not intended for cats can be toxic to them). [ 196 ] [ 197 ] 

In addition to guides for cat owners, guidelines have also been published for veterinarians and caregivers to improve the welfare of cats under their care. The AAFP and ISFM have issued recommendations for cat-friendly interactions in veterinary clinics. [ 198 ] 

# Ecology 

# Habitats 

A Siamese cat living among the yurts of shepherds in the Altai Mountains , Russia 

The domestic cat is a cosmopolitan species and occurs across much of the world. [ 47 ] It is adaptable and now present on all continents except Antarctica , and on 118 of the 131 main groups of islands, even on the remote Kerguelen Islands . [ 199 ] [ 200 ] Due to its ability to thrive in almost any terrestrial habitat, it is among the world's most invasive species . [ 201 ] It lives on small islands with no human inhabitants. [ 202 ] Feral cats can live in forests, grasslands, tundra, coastal areas, agricultural land, scrublands, urban areas, and wetlands. [ 203 ] 

The unwantedness that leads to the domestic cat being treated as an invasive species is twofold. As it is little altered from the wildcat, it can readily interbreed with the wildcat. This hybridization poses a danger to the genetic distinctiveness of some wildcat populations, particularly in Scotland and Hungary , possibly also the Iberian Peninsula , and where protected natural areas are close to human-dominated landscapes, such as Kruger National Park in South Africa . [ 204 ] [ 48 ] However, its introduction to places where no native felines are present also contributes to the decline of native species. [ 205 ] 

# Ferality 

Main article: Feral cat 
Feral farm cat 

Feral cats are domestic cats that were born in or have reverted to a wild state. They are unfamiliar with and wary of humans and roam freely in urban and rural areas. [ 206 ] The numbers of feral cats are not known, but estimates of the United States feral population range from 25 to 60 million. [ 206 ] Feral cats may live alone, but most are in large colonies , which occupy a specific territory and are usually associated with a source of food. [ 207 ] Famous feral cat colonies are in Rome around the Colosseum and Forum Romanum , some being fed and given medical attention by volunteers. [ 208 ] 

Public attitudes toward feral cats vary widely, from seeing them as free-ranging pets to regarding them as vermin . [ 209 ] 

# Impact on wildlife 

Main article: Cat predation on wildlife 
Cats kill billions of wild birds each year. This feral cat near Brisbane has caught a Pale-headed rosella . 

Domestic cats are a contributing factor to the decline of several species, a factor that has ultimately led, in some cases, to extinction. The South Island piopio , Chatham rail , [ 149 ] and the New Zealand merganser [ 210 ] are a few from a long list, with the most extreme case being the flightless Lyall's wren , which was driven to extinction only a few years after its discovery. [ 211 ] [ 212 ] One feral cat in New Zealand killed 102 New Zealand lesser short-tailed bats in seven days. [ 213 ] In the United States, feral and free-ranging domestic cats kill an estimated 6.3–22.3 billion mammals annually. [ 147 ] 

In Australia, one study found feral cats to kill 466 million reptiles per year. More than 258 reptile species were identified as being predated by cats. [ 214 ] Cats have contributed to the extinction of the Navassa curly-tailed lizard and Chioninia coctei . [ 205 ] 

# Interaction with humans 

Main article: Human interaction with cats 
A cat lying on a man's lap 

Cats are common pets throughout the world, and their worldwide population as of 2007 exceeded 500 million. [ 215 ] As of 2024, [update] the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States , with 73.8 million cats owned and around 42.2 million households owning at least one cat. [ 216 ] [ 217 ] In the United Kingdom , 26% of adults have a cat, with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020. [update] [ 218 ] As of 2021, [update] there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world. [ 219 ] 

Cats have been used for millennia to control rodents, notably around grain stores and aboard ships , and both uses extend to the present day. [ 220 ] [ 221 ] Cats are also used in the international fur trade [ 222 ] and leather industries for making coats, hats, blankets, stuffed toys, [ 223 ] shoes, gloves, and musical instruments. [ 224 ] About 24 cats are needed to make a cat-fur coat. [ 225 ] This use has been outlawed in the United States since 2000 and in the European Union (as well as the United Kingdom) since 2007. [ 226 ] 

Cat pelts have been used for superstitious purposes as part of the practice of witchcraft , [ 227 ] and they are still made into blankets in Switzerland as traditional medicines thought to cure rheumatism . [ 228 ] 

A few attempts to build a cat census have been made over the years, both through associations or national and international organizations (such as that of the Canadian Federation of Humane Societies [ 229 ] ) and over the Internet. [ 230 ] [ 231 ] General estimates for the global population of domestic cats range widely from anywhere between 200 million to 600 million. [ 232 ] [ 233 ] [ 234 ] [ 235 ] [ 236 ] Walter Chandoha made his career photographing cats after his 1949 images of Loco , a stray cat, were published. He is reported to have photographed 90,000 cats during his career and maintained an archive of 225,000 images that he drew from for publications during his lifetime. [ 237 ] 

Pet humanization is a form of anthropomorphism in which cats are kept for companionship and treated more like human family members than traditional pets. [ 238 ] This trend of pet culture involves providing cats with a higher level of care, attention and often even luxury, similar to the way humans are treated. [ 239 ] 

# Shows 

Main article: Cat show 

A cat show is a judged event in which the owners of cats compete to win titles in various cat-registering organizations by entering their cats to be judged after a breed standard. [ 240 ] It is often required that a cat must be healthy and vaccinated to participate in a cat show. [ 240 ] Both pedigreed and non- purebred companion ("moggy") cats are admissible, although the rules differ depending on the organization. Competing cats are compared to the applicable breed standard, and assessed for temperament. [ 240 ] 

# Infection 

Main article: Feline zoonosis 

Cats can be infected or infested with viruses , pathogenic bacteria , fungus , protozoans , arthropods or worms that can transmit diseases to humans; infections of most concern include salmonella , cat-scratch disease , and toxoplasmosis . [ 241 ] In some cases, the cat exhibits no symptoms of the disease. [ 242 ] The same disease can then become evident in a human. [ 243 ] The likelihood that a person will become diseased depends on the age and immune status of the person. Others might also acquire infections from cat feces and parasites exiting the cat's body. [ 241 ] [ 244 ] 

# History and mythology 

Main articles: Cultural depictions of cats and Cats in ancient Egypt 

The ancient Egyptians mummified dead cats out of respect in the same way that they mummified people. [ 245 ] 

An ancient Roman mosaic depicts a cat killing a partridge from the House of the Faun in Pompeii . 

A 19th-century drawing of a tabby cat 

Some cultures superstitiously attribute good or bad luck to black cats. 

In ancient Egypt , cats were revered . The goddess Bastet was often depicted in cat form, sometimes taking on the war-like aspect of a lioness. The Greek historian Herodotus reported that killing a cat was forbidden, and when a household cat died, the entire family mourned and shaved their eyebrows. Families took their dead cats to the sacred city of Bubastis , where they were embalmed and buried in sacred repositories. Herodotus expressed astonishment at the domestic cats in Egypt, because he had only ever seen wildcats. [ 246 ] 

Ancient Greeks and Romans kept weasels as pets, which were seen as the ideal rodent-killers. The earliest unmistakable evidence of the Greeks having domestic cats comes from two coins from Magna Graecia dating to the mid-fifth century BC showing Iokastos and Phalanthos, the legendary founders of Rhegion and Taras respectively, playing with their pet cats. The usual ancient Greek word for 'cat' was ailouros , meaning 'thing with the waving tail'. Cats are rarely mentioned in ancient Greek literature . Aristotle remarked in his History of Animals that "female cats are naturally lecherous ". The Greeks later syncretized their own goddess Artemis with the Egyptian goddess Bastet, adopting Bastet's associations with cats and ascribing them to Artemis. In Ovid 's Metamorphoses , when the deities flee to Egypt and take animal forms, the goddess Diana turns into a cat. [ 247 ] [ 248 ] 

Cats eventually displaced weasels as the pest control of choice because they were more pleasant to have around the house and were more enthusiastic hunters of mice. During the Middle Ages , many of Artemis's associations with cats were grafted onto the Virgin Mary . Cats are often shown in icons of Annunciation and of the Holy Family and, according to Italian folklore , on the same night that Mary gave birth to Jesus , a cat in Bethlehem gave birth to a kitten. [ 249 ] Domestic cats were spread throughout much of the rest of the world during the Age of Discovery , as ships' cats were carried on sailing ships to control shipboard rodents and as good-luck charms. [ 39 ] 

Several ancient religions believed cats are exalted souls, companions or guides for humans, that are all-knowing but mute so they cannot influence decisions made by humans. In Japan, the maneki neko cat is a symbol of good fortune. [ 250 ] In Norse mythology , Freyja , the goddess of love, beauty, and fertility, is depicted as riding a chariot drawn by cats. [ 251 ] In Jewish legend , the first cat was living in the house of the first man Adam as a pet that got rid of mice . The cat was once partnering with the first dog before the latter broke an oath they had made which resulted in enmity between the descendants of these two animals. It is also written that neither cats nor foxes are represented in the water, while every other animal has an incarnation species in the water. [ 252 ] Although no species are sacred in Islam, cats are revered by Muslims . Some Western writers have stated Muhammad had a favorite cat, Muezza . [ 253 ] He is reported to have loved cats so much, "he would do without his cloak rather than disturb one that was sleeping on it". [ 254 ] The story has no origin in early Muslim writers, and seems to confuse a story of a later Sufi saint, Ahmed ar-Rifa'i , centuries after Muhammad. [ 255 ] One of the companions of Muhammad was known as Abu Hurayrah ("father of the kitten"), in reference to his documented affection to cats. [ 256 ] 

# Superstitions and rituals 

The Love Potion is a 1903 painting by Evelyn De Morgan depicting a witch with a black cat. 

Many cultures have negative superstitions about cats. For example, that encountering a black cat ("crossing one's path") [ 257 ] leads to bad luck, or that cats are witches' familiar spirits used to augment a witch's powers and skills. The killing of cats in medieval Ypres , Belgium , is commemorated in the innocuous present-day Kattenstoet (cat parade). [ 258 ] 

According to a myth in many cultures, cats have multiple lives. In many countries, they are believed to have nine lives, but in Italy, Germany, Greece, Brazil, and some Spanish-speaking regions, they are said to have seven lives, [ 259 ] [ 260 ] while in Arabic traditions, the number of lives is six. [ 261 ] An early mention of the myth is in John Heywood 's The Proverbs of John Heywood (1546): [ 262 ] 

Husband, ( quoth she), ye studie, be merrie now, And even as ye thinke now, so come to yow. Nay not so, (quoth he), for my thought to tell right, I thinke how you lay groning , wife, all last night. Husband, a groning horse and a groning wife Never faile their master , (quoth she), for my life. No wife, a woman hath nine lives like a cat . 

The myth is attributed to the natural suppleness and swiftness cats exhibit to escape life-threatening situations. [ 263 ] Falling cats often land on their feet, using an instinctive righting reflex to twist their bodies around. [ 264 ]

# Notes 

- ^ Driscoll, Macdonald & O'Brien 2009 did not conclude a date for genetic divergence, noting from archaeological evidence that "the broadest range of dates for domestication to be from 11,000 to 4,000 B.P.".

Caesar cipher with a left shift of 3 

A Caesar cipher , also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code, or the Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques in cryptography . Named after Julius Caesar , who is said to have used it, it is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet . For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on (pictured) . Caesar is believed to have used one in his private correspondence, and a similar one was used by his nephew, Augustus . The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated as part of more complex schemes, such as the Vigenère cipher , and still has modern application in the ROT13 system. As with all single-alphabet substitution ciphers, the Caesar cipher is easily broken and in modern practice offers essentially no communications security . ( Full article... )

# Today's featured picture 

The blackberry is an edible fruit produced by many species in the genus Rubus in the family Rosaceae . Blackberries are typically produced from hybrid plants among the species within the subgenus Rubus , or hybrids between the subgenera Rubus and Idaeobatus . Similar to the raspberry, it is not a berry in the botanical sense, being classified as an aggregate fruit composed of small drupelets . Blackberries are perennial plants bearing biennial stems from their roots. Unmanaged plants tend to aggregate in a dense tangle of stems and branches, which can be controlled in gardens or farms using trellises . Blackberry shrubs can tolerate poor soils, spreading readily in wasteland, ditches, and roadsides. Blackberries grow wild throughout most of Europe. They are an important element in the ecology of many countries, and harvesting the berries is a common pastime. In some parts of the world, however, there are blackberry species that are considered to be an invasive species . The fruit is also grown commercially, with Mexico being the leading producer, exporting for sale in off-season fresh markets in North America and Europe. This photograph, which was focus-stacked from 23 separate images, depicts a blackberry of the species Rubus fruticosus .

This is a general introduction for visitors to Wikipedia. For aspiring contributors, also see this guide and tutorial . For other uses, see Wikipedia:Wikipedia (disambiguation) . 

Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That's what we're doing. — Jimmy Wales 

Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit, and millions already have . 

Wikipedia's purpose is to benefit readers by presenting information on all branches of knowledge . Hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation , Wikipedia consists of freely editable content, with articles that usually contain numerous links guiding readers to more information. 

Written collaboratively by volunteers known as Wikipedians , Wikipedia articles can be edited by anyone with Internet access , except in limited cases in which editing is restricted to prevent disruption or vandalism . Since its creation on January 15, 2001 , it has grown into the world's largest reference website , attracting over a billion visitors each month . Wikipedia currently has more than sixty-six million articles in more than 300 languages , including 7,107,827 articles in English , with 302,746 active contributors in the past month. 
A short video explaining how Wikipedia works 

Wikipedia's fundamental principles are summarized in its five pillars . While the Wikipedia community has developed many policies and guidelines , new editors do not need to be familiar with them before they start contributing. 

Anyone can edit Wikipedia's text, data, references, and images. The quality of content is more important than the expertise of who contributes it. Wikipedia's content must conform with its policies , including being verifiable by published reliable sources . Contributions based on personal opinions , beliefs, or personal experiences, unreviewed research , libellous material, and copyright violations are not allowed, and will not remain. Wikipedia's software makes it easy to reverse errors, and experienced editors watch and patrol bad edits. 

Wikipedia differs from printed references in important ways . Anyone can instantly improve it, add quality information, remove misinformation, and fix errors and vandalism . Since Wikipedia is continually updated, encyclopedic articles on major news events appear within minutes. 

For over 24 years, editors have volunteered their time and talents to create history's most comprehensive encyclopedia while providing references and other resources to researchers worldwide (see Researching with Wikipedia ). In summary, Wikipedia has tested the wisdom of the crowd since 2001 and has found that it succeeds. 

To start editing, simply click the Edit or Edit source button, or the pencil icon , at the top of any non-protected Wikipedia page or section.

Thank you for your interest in contacting Wikipedia. Before proceeding, some important disclaimers: 

- Wikipedia has no central editorial board. Contributions are made by a large number of volunteers at their own discretion. Edits are neither the responsibility of the Wikimedia Foundation (the organisation that hosts the site) nor of its staff. 
- Generally, the agent who responds to an email request will not make edits on your behalf. 
- Disagreements with content will not be resolved via email. Use the Edit Request Wizard to propose specific changes to an article. 
- Although Wikipedia was founded by Jimmy Wales , he is not personally responsible for our content. 
- If you have questions about the concept of Wikipedia rather than a specific problem, the About Wikipedia page may help. 
- If you want to ask other users for help with editing or using Wikipedia, stop by the Teahouse , Wikipedia's live help channel , or the help desk to ask someone for assistance. 
- If you disagree with an article's content, or are involved in a content dispute, see Dispute resolution . 

The links on the left should direct you to how to contact us or resolve problems. If you cannot find your issue listed there, you can email helpful, experienced volunteers at info-en wikimedia.org .

# Tip of the day 

Advice for parents 

The Wikipedia help page , Advice for parents , is provided to help parents, guardians, teachers, and other adults consider the best way to allow children they are responsible for to engage with Wikipedia safely and enjoyably. 

The most useful piece of advice  guardians can give to younger editors  is to never divulge any personally identifiable information (name, age, location, school) on Wikipedia‍—‌or anywhere else publicly available on the Internet for that matter. Wikipedia is not censored , and contains explicit material and images. Parental controls may be able to help. 

You may also be interested in another independent project, the Schools' Wikipedia ‍—‌a specific selection of about 5,500 articles from the English Wikipedia, suitable for school children, which has been checked and edited for this audience.

Tutorial for new editors 

Introduction to Wikipedia 

Wikipedia is made by people like you . 
This page takes you through a set of tutorials aimed at complete newcomers who wish to contribute. It covers all the basics, and each tutorial takes only a few minutes, so you can become a proficient Wikipedian quickly. 

Get started Policies and Guidelines 

The wiki markup source editor shows the underlying page source code. It works like a plain text file, indicating links and other items using simple code like this: [[Earth]] . 

Editing Referencing Images Tables 

VisualEditor is the easier way of editing that works more like a word processor and hides the underlying source code. Links and other items are edited using toolbar and pop-up interfaces.

# Community bulletin board 

This section is transcluded from Wikipedia:Community bulletin board . ( edit | history ) 

How to add to the community bulletin board 

The community bulletin board has 2 sections that can be used by Wikipedians for announcements: "Events and projects" and "WikiProject notices". In general, keep it concise (under 2 lines), refrain from fancy formatting , and new entries should be placed at the top of their section. 
- Before editing, make sure you are on Wikipedia:Community bulletin board , not Wikipedia:Community portal , where the board is transcluded. 
- Events and projects : In this section, only organized events, projects, and/or competitions should be listed. These are organized by how often they occur: 
- The Yearly section is for uncommon events, like events that only occur every year, once, or irregularly. The Monthly section is for events that occur each month, or are always ongoing. 
- WikiProject notices : In this section, any announcement, request for help or other notice from a WikiProject should be listed here. 
- Entries should be signed, and ordered from newest to oldest. 
- Entries are to be removed after a period of 6 months . 

Welcome to the community bulletin board , which is a page used for announcements from WikiProjects and other groups. Included here are coordinated efforts, events, projects, and other general announcements.

Technical news 

This section is transcluded from Wikipedia:Tech news . ( edit | history ) 

Latest tech news from the Wikimedia technical community. Please tell other users about these changes. Not all changes will affect you. Translations are available. 

Updates for editors 

- View all 18 community-submitted tasks that were resolved last week . For example, one of the fixes addressed an issue for temporary accounts adding an external URL, which triggered an hCaptcha request in more cases than intended, and did not display the required popup on the first attempt to publish the edit. [1] 

Updates for technical contributors 

- To improve database and site performance, external links to Wikimedia projects will no longer be stored in the database. This means they will not be searchable in Special:LinkSearch , will not be checked by the Spam Blacklist or AbuseFilter as new links, and will not be in the externallinks table on database replicas. In the future this may be extended to other highly-linked trusted websites on a per-wiki basis, such as Creative Commons links on Wikimedia Commons. [2] 
- Detailed code updates later this week: MediaWiki

# Tip of the day 

Tip of the day... 

Accuracy, quality and peer review 

We strive to make Wikipedia as accurate and as good as possible. If you see something you know is wrong, be bold and fix it. If you see something that seems wrong, leave a note on the article talk page and remove questionable assertions if no supporting evidence is provided. You can also use a verification template to add a citation needed tag after the text in question. 

Peer review for accuracy and quality happens constantly through the Recent changes page and watchlists . A review can also be solicited on Wikipedia:Peer review , Wikipedia:Article assessment , and Wikipedia:Good article nominations .  If you believe an article is really good, nominate it at Wikipedia:Featured article candidates . More sophisticated approval mechanisms are under constant discussion. Regardless, we do not guarantee accuracy and have a variety of other disclaimers . These are linked from every page, so please do not add more disclaimers to articles! 

There is a semi-automated peer review available. The easiest way to install the script is to enable it as a Gadget : go to your user Preferences and check off the MoreMenu, adds Page and User dropdown menus to the toolbar... entry under Appearance and hit save. Each article page will then have a Page and User pull down menu near the top; go to the article; hover on Page ; hover on Tools ; click on Peer reviewer .

Wikimedia file upload wizard 

Shortcut 

- WP:FUW WP:FUW 

Thank you for offering to contribute an image or other media file for use on Wikipedia. This wizard will guide you through a questionnaire prompting you for the appropriate copyright and sourcing information for each file. Please ensure you understand copyright and the image use policy before proceeding. 

Upload your own or a freely-licensed file 

Uploads to Wikimedia Commons 

Upload a non-free file 

Uploads locally to the English Wikipedia; must comply with the non-free content criteria 

You do not have JavaScript enabled 

Sorry, in order to use this uploading script, JavaScript must be enabled. You can still use the plain Special:Upload page to upload files to the English Wikipedia without JavaScript. 

You are not currently logged in. 

Sorry, in order to use this uploading script and to upload files, you need to be logged in with your named account. Please log in and then try again. 

Your account has not become confirmed yet. 

Sorry, in order to upload files on the English Wikipedia, you need to have a confirmed account . Normally, your account will become confirmed automatically once you have made 10 edits and four days have passed since you created it. 

You may already be able to upload files on the Wikimedia Commons , but you can't do it on the English Wikipedia just yet. If the file you want to upload has a free license, please go to Commons and upload it there. 

Important note: if you don't want to wait until you are autoconfirmed, you may ask somebody else to upload a file for you at Wikipedia:Files for upload . 

In very rare cases an administrator may make your account confirmed manually through a request at Wikipedia:Requests for permissions/Confirmed . 

# Step 1: Choose your file 

File: Choose a file from your computer. Maximum file size: 100 MB. Permitted file types: png, gif, jpg, jpeg, xcf, pdf, mid, mp3, mpeg, mpg, ogg, ogv, opus, svg, djvu, tiff, tif, oga, flac, wav, wave, webm, webp. 

# Step 2: Describe your file 

Please provide a clear, descriptive name by which your file will be known on Wikipedia. This name must be unique across the whole of Wikipedia, so please make it informative and easy to recognize. It's no problem to use a fairly long name. It may also include spaces, commas and most other punctuation marks. Please also note that file names are case sensitive (with the exception of the first letter). Good: "City of London, skyline from London City Hall, Oct 2008.jpg". Bad : "Skyline.jpg", "DSC0001234.jpg". 

Sorry, a few special characters and character combinations cannot be used in the filename for technical reasons. This goes especially for # < > [ ] | : { } / and ~~~ . Your filename has been modified to avoid these. Please check if it is okay now. 

The filename you chose seems to be very short, or overly generic. Please don't use: 

- Titles that consist only of very generic descriptive words (e.g. "Sunset.jpg", "Townhall.jpg") 
- Titles that consist only of a person's first or last name, when that name is likely to be shared by many others (e.g. "John.jpg", "Miller.jpg") 
- Titles that consist of mere numbers, of the kind often produced by digital cameras ("DSC_001234", "IMGP0345"), or random strings like those sometimes found on the web ("30996951316264l.jpg") 

Existing file . Last uploaded by Example user . 

A file of this name already exists on Commons! 

If you upload your file with this name, you will be masking the existing file and make it inaccessible. Your new file will be displayed everywhere the existing file was previously used. 

This should not be done, except in very rare exceptional cases. 

Please don't upload your file under this name, unless you seriously know what you are doing. Choose a different name for your new file instead. 
If you want to replace the existing file with an uncontroversial, improved version of the same work, please go to Commons and upload it there, not here on the English Wikipedia's local wiki. 

A file of this name already exists. 

If you upload your file with this name, you will be overwriting the existing file. Your new file will be displayed everywhere the existing file was previously used. Please don't do this, unless you have a good reason to: 
No , I don't want to overwrite the existing file. I will choose a different name for my new file instead. Yes , I want to overwrite the existing file. My file is merely a new, improved and uncontentious version of the same work. The old description page, including the source and copyright information, will still be correct for the new version and can remain the same. Yes , I want to overwrite the existing file, and I will use this wizard to add a new description and new source information for it. The previous version was my own, or else I have made sure the previous uploader(s) don't object to this replacement. 

Please provide a brief description of the contents of this file. This will be stored and displayed as part of the file description page. It is important that other editors are able to understand what this file is about. What does this file show? What is it a photo/diagram/recording of? It will be helpful if you also add a wikilink to the article where you want to use it. 

# Step 3: Provide source and copyright information 

It is very important that you read through the following options and questions, and provide all required information truthfully and carefully. 
This is a free work. I can demonstrate that it is legally okay for anybody to use, in Wikipedia and elsewhere, for any purpose. 

Thank you for offering to upload a free work. 

Wikipedia loves free files. However, we would love it even more if you uploaded them on our sister project, Wikimedia Commons .
Files uploaded on Commons can be used immediately here on Wikipedia as well as on all its sister projects. Uploading files on Commons works just the same as here. Your Wikipedia account will automatically work on Commons too. 

Please consider uploading your file on Commons . 

However, if you prefer to do it here instead, you may go ahead with this form. You can also first use this form to collect the information about your file and then send it to Commons from here. 

Copyright status: This file is entirely my own work. I am the copyright holder. I made this myself, from scratch, without copying or incorporating anybody else's creative work, and I am willing to release it under a free license. 

Please note that by "entirely self-made" we really mean just that. 

Do not use this section for any of the following: 

- a scan or photograph you made of a painting, drawing, printed page or other item originally created by somebody else. The copyright belongs to the original creator, not to you. 
- a screenshot or other kind of capture of a video, computer screen, TV programme or other kind of visual media. 
- a picture you created by modifying or copying some other picture or by combining several preexisting pictures made by somebody else. 
- a picture given to you by somebody else. 
- a picture you found somewhere on the Internet. 

Editors who falsely declare such items as their "own work" will be blocked from editing . 

Please describe how and when you created this item. How? (e.g.: Where and on what kind of occasion did you take this photo? How did you make this diagram? etc.) Date (please use YYYY-MM-DD format if possible). Publication: Please indicate here if you have previously published this item elsewhere, e.g. on your own website, your Flickr or Facebook account, etc., providing a link. It is important that you place this work under a free license, which will allow everybody else to use it for any purpose, including both commercial and non-commercial purposes, and to modify it. This license will be irrevocable. 
This file was given to me by its owner. The copyright owner of this file has given it to me for uploading on Wikipedia. I can provide evidence that they have agreed to release it under a free license, for free use by anybody and for any purpose. 

Please describe who owns this work and how you got it from them. Owner/author: Date of creation: Source: Where did you get the file from? (e.g. available online; was sent to me personally …) Permission: How did you receive the permission? (e.g.: by e-mail, personally, I work for the owner …) The copyright owner has chosen the following license: License: Other: Evidence: The license statement can be found online at: The license agreement has been forwarded to Wikimedia's volunteer response team at "permissions-en@wikimedia.org". OTRS ticket received: The license hasn't yet been forwarded, but I will do so shortly or ask the owner to send it. I haven't got the evidence right now, but I will provide some if requested to do so. Note: files without verifiable permissions may be deleted. You may be better off obtaining proof of permission first. 
This file is from a free published source. I took it from a website or other published source, where its author has explicitly placed it under a free license, allowing free re-use by anybody. 

Use this only if there is an explicit licensing statement in the source. 

The website must explicitly say that the image is released under a license that allows free re-use for any purpose, e.g. the Creative Commons Attribution license. You must be able to point exactly to where it says this. 

If the source website doesn't say so explicitly, please do not upload the file . 

Author/owner: Date of creation: Source: For web sources: please provide a link to the html web page where the file can be found ("http://... .html"), not a direct link to the image file itself ("http://... .jpg"). For print sources: provide full bibliographic information (author, title, publisher, year, page, etc.) The copyright owner has chosen the following license for this file: License: Other: Evidence: Provide a link to where the author explicitly says that the file is released under a free license. (if not visible on the source page itself). 
This work is so old its copyright has expired This is an old photograph, or a photographic reproduction of an old painting, drawing, etc. I can provide enough information about its author and provenance to prove that it is old enough for its copyright to have expired. It is now legally in the Public Domain . 

Original author: Please name the original author of this work. Lifetime: Specify date of death, if applicable to public domain status. In many cases, we need to be certain the author died before a certain year, in many cases before 1930. Original publication: Provide as much information as possible about the original time and place of publication of this work. For print publications: provide full bibliographic information. Date of publication: Provide date of first publication, and date of creation if different. Immediate source: State exactly where you found this file. For web sources: please provide a link to the html web page where the file can be found ("http://... .html"), not a direct link to the image file itself ("http://... .jpg"). For print sources: provide full bibliographic information (author, title, publisher, year, page, etc.) Public Domain status: This work is free of all copyrights because: It was created and first published before 1930 and is therefore in the Public Domain in the US. It was first published outside the US , and it was in the Public Domain in its country of origin by the " URAA date ". For most countries, this means the author died 70 years before 1 January 1996, i.e. before 1926. Please look up the copyright rules for the specific country at [1] . It was first published in the US before 1989 , and its copyright expired because it was published without a copyright notice and/or without the necessary copyright registration. Please look up the exact rules at [2] . Its copyright expired for some other reason. [Please explain below]. Explanation: Please provide any evidence necessary to verify the public domain status. 
This file is in the Public Domain for some other reason. I can demonstrate that this work is legally in the Public Domain, i.e. nobody owns any copyrights on it. This may be for a variety of reasons, for instance because it was created by the US Federal Government, or because it is too simple to attract any copyright. 

Public Domain means that nobody owns any copyrights on this work. It does not mean simply that it is freely viewable somewhere on the web or that it has been widely used by others. 

This is not for images you simply found somewhere on the web. Most images on the web are under copyright and belong to somebody, even if you believe the owner won't care about that copyright. If it is in the public domain, you must be able to point to an actual law that makes it so. If you can't point to such a law but merely found this image somewhere, then please do not upload it. 

Author: Please name the original author of this work. Source: State exactly where you found this file. For web sources: please provide a link to the html web page where the file can be found ("http://... .html"), not a direct link to the image file itself ("http://... .jpg"). For print sources: provide full bibliographic information (author, title, publisher, year, page, etc.) Date of creation: Public Domain status: This work is free of all copyrights because: It was created by an agency of the US Federal Government. This does not apply to most US state and local agencies , nor to governments of other countries! It is an official governmental item, such as a flag, state emblem, banknote or postage stamp, from a country where such items are exempt from copyright according to local law. This does not apply to all countries, nor does it usually apply to all publications! (For instance, it usually doesn't apply to simple publicity photographs published on a governmental website.)  Please look up the copyright rules for the specific country in question. If the country does not have an exemption rule that applies to this item, go on with the section for " non-free copyrighted works " below. Explanation: Add any explanation or evidence necessary to substantiate your statement above. Cite and provide a link to the relevant law if possible. It is too simple to be eligible for copyright. This typically applies only to graphics that consist solely of simple geometric shapes and/or a few letters or words, or to items such as mathematical or chemical formulae. It may apply to some very simple logos that do not contain complex pictorial elements. It never applies to photographs! It is in the Public Domain for some other reason. Explanation: 

This is a copyrighted, non-free work, but I believe it is Fair Use. I have read the Wikipedia rules on Non-Free Content , and I am prepared to explain how the use of this file will meet the criteria set out there. 

Please remember that you will need to demonstrate that: 

- The file will serve an important function in a particular article; ( NFCC8 ) 
- It cannot be replaced by any other, free illustration that might yet be created; ( NFCC1 ) 
- Its use does not negatively affect the commercial interests of its owner ( NFCC2 ) 
- There will not be more non-free material used than necessary. ( NFCC3 ) 

This file will be used in the following article: 

Enter the name of exactly one Wikipedia article, without the [[...]] brackets and without the "http://en.wikipedia.org/..." URL code. It has to be an actual article, not a talkpage, template, user page, etc. If you plan to use the file in more than one article, please name only one of them here. Then, after uploading, open the image description page for editing and add your separate explanations for each additional article manually. 

Example – article okay. 

This article doesn't exist! 

The article Example could not be found. 

Please check the spelling, and make sure you enter the name of an existing article in which you will include this file. 

If this is an article you are only planning to write, please write it first and upload the file afterwards. 

This is not an actual encyclopedia article! 

The page Example is not in the main article namespace. Non-free files can only be used in mainspace article pages, not on a user page, talk page, template, etc. 

Please upload this file only if it is going to be used in an actual article. 

If this page is an article draft in your user space, we're sorry, but we must ask you to wait until the page is ready and has been moved into mainspace, and only upload the file after that. 

This is a disambiguation page! 

The page Example is not a real article, but a disambiguation page pointing to a number of other pages. 

Please check and enter the exact title of the actual target article you meant. 

Non-free use rationale This image is the object of discussion in an article. This is a copyrighted artwork or photograph, and the image itself is the topic of discussion in the article.

For subjects who died recently: have you made a reasonable effort to find people who might possess photographs of this person and might be willing to release one? For subjects who lived in the early-to-mid 20th century: have you considered if there might be an older photograph that has fallen in the public domain? Please explain why you are confident that our use of the file will not harm any commercial opportunities of its owner. We will typically not use a file if its owner has a potential commercial interest in its use, and if our use of it would compete with its original market role. 
This is some other kind of non-free work that I believe is legitimate Fair Use. This is a copyrighted work whose use does not fall into any of the classes above. I have read the Wikipedia rules on Non-free content , and I will explain how this file meets all of the criteria set out there. 

Which of these options describes this item best? Author: (Who made this image?) Original publication: (Where, when and how was this image first published?) Date of publication: Source: (Where exactly did you get this file from?) Please explain what exact purpose this file will serve in the article. Please be concrete and specific. Don't just copy boilerplate statements from elsewhere. State clearly, in your own words, what this particular file will be doing in this particular article. Your explanation must make it clear why the article would be significantly worse off without this file. Please explain why this purpose could not be served by text alone. Please explain why this purpose could not be served with an alternative, free illustration that could yet be found or created. For a file to be deemed replaceable, it is not necessary that a suitable replacement already exists. Even if it is merely possible that a replacement could be created, we will not use the non-free file. Please explain why you are confident that our use of the file will not harm any commercial opportunities of its owner. We will typically not use a file if its owner has a potential commercial interest in its use, and if our use of it would compete with its original market role. Remember that the use of non-free files must be minimal. This can mean several things: 

- Don't use more files per article/topic than necessary 
- Don't use the same file in more articles than necessary 
- Don't use larger excerpts of a single work than necessary 
- Don't use images of higher resolution than necessary 

In view of this, please explain how the use of this file will be minimal. 
Special source and license conditions (optional) Any further relevant information about this file? 

Edit summary: A brief description of why you are overwriting this file. This will not be saved on the description page, but will be shown in its edit history. 

Yes , I want this file to be immediately available in all Wikimedia projects, in all languages. I will upload it on the Wikimedia Commons . Clicking this button will redirect you to a page on Commons. This will only work if you are already logged in there, which is likely the case if you have a unified account . Check here to see if you are logged in. 
No , I want to upload this file locally. This way it can be used only on the English Wikipedia. We urge you to upload it to the Commons unless there is a very good reason for it to stay local. Often such local files are copied to the Commons for use elsewhere and deleted locally, requiring extra work for other volunteers. If you do not want your file to be copied to Commons and deleted locally, consider adding the {{ Keep local }} tag. Reset this form and start over. 

This file doesn't fit either of the categories above. This file doesn't seem to fall into either of the classes above, or I am not certain what its status is. I found this file somewhere, but I don't really know who made it or who owns it. 

Well, we're very sorry, but if you're not sure about this file's copyright status, or if it doesn't fit into any of the groups above, then: 

Please don't upload it. 

Really, please don't. Even if you think it would make for a great addition to an article. We really take these copyright rules very seriously on Wikipedia. Note that media is assumed to be fully-copyrighted unless shown otherwise; the burden is on the uploader. 

In particular, please don't upload: 

- any file you simply found on some website, without knowing who its author or copyright owner is. 
- any file you found somewhere, even if you have good reason to believe it has a copyright owner who would not mind us using it, but you don't have an explicit licensing statement from them. 
- any file that was released for publicity purposes by its owners but doesn't have a fully-free license for free re-use for all purposes. 
- any file credited to a commercial image agency, such as Reuters, AP or Getty Images. Such files normally cannot be used even under the "Fair Use" rules, except in rare cases. 
- any file that is licensed for use exclusively on Wikipedia, or is free except that the free license excludes commercial use. 

If you are in any doubt, please ask some experienced editors for advice before uploading. People will be happy to assist you at Wikipedia:Media copyright questions . Thank you.

Caesar cipher with a left shift of 3 

A Caesar cipher , also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code, or the Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques in cryptography . Named after Julius Caesar , who is said to have used it, it is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet . For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on (pictured) . Caesar is believed to have used one in his private correspondence, and a similar one was used by his nephew, Augustus . The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated as part of more complex schemes, such as the Vigenère cipher , and still has modern application in the ROT13 system. As with all single-alphabet substitution ciphers, the Caesar cipher is easily broken and in modern practice offers essentially no communications security . ( Full article... )

# Today's featured picture 

The blackberry is an edible fruit produced by many species in the genus Rubus in the family Rosaceae . Blackberries are typically produced from hybrid plants among the species within the subgenus Rubus , or hybrids between the subgenera Rubus and Idaeobatus . Similar to the raspberry, it is not a berry in the botanical sense, being classified as an aggregate fruit composed of small drupelets . Blackberries are perennial plants bearing biennial stems from their roots. Unmanaged plants tend to aggregate in a dense tangle of stems and branches, which can be controlled in gardens or farms using trellises . Blackberry shrubs can tolerate poor soils, spreading readily in wasteland, ditches, and roadsides. Blackberries grow wild throughout most of Europe. They are an important element in the ecology of many countries, and harvesting the berries is a common pastime. In some parts of the world, however, there are blackberry species that are considered to be an invasive species . The fruit is also grown commercially, with Mexico being the leading producer, exporting for sale in off-season fresh markets in North America and Europe. This photograph, which was focus-stacked from 23 separate images, depicts a blackberry of the species Rubus fruticosus .

# Deleting URLs from citations 
[ edit ] 

BhagyaMani you deleted some live URLs from cites saying they're not needed if there's a DOI [1] . I've never heard that before, can you cite a PAG that recommends deleting live URLs from citations? Geogene ( talk ) 13:44, 23 August 2025 (UTC) [ reply ] 
Check the dois yourself to see that they redirect to the urls. – BhagyaMani ( talk ) 13:48, 23 August 2025 (UTC) [ reply ] You can check the doi and add |doi-access=free which will then add the link to the title. There is a comment at the end of the identifier section of the cite journal documentation about not adding duplicate urls. It doesn't say delete them but gives a reason to leave them free.  — Jts1882 | talk 14:54, 23 August 2025 (UTC) [ reply ]

The fitness gram pacer test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. 65.51.53.243 ( talk ) 12:26, 12 September 2025 (UTC) [ reply ] 
Not done: it's not clear what changes you want to be made. Please mention the specific changes in a "change X to Y" format and provide a reliable source if appropriate. Day Creature ( talk ) 13:29, 12 September 2025 (UTC) [ reply ] 

# Small typo in Cat Intelligence section 
[ edit ] 

"studies concludes" should be changed to "studies conclude," in the last sentence of the first paragraph of the section. 2604:2D80:2480:5900:2C69:8EE6:76F9:2194 ( talk ) 12:41, 16 October 2025 (UTC) [ reply ] 
Done I wonder if "studies conclude" should be changed to "studies indicate".  — Jts1882 | talk 14:12, 16 October 2025 (UTC) [ reply ] 

# Phylogenetic trees broken on mobile web 
[ edit ] 

On mobile web the phylogenetic trees are cut-off half-way. It seems like their boxes have a set size that is too small to fit the entire tree. Joe vom Titan ( talk ) 21:18, 27 November 2025 (UTC) [ reply ] 
The edit I just made (removed the height=) seemed to fix this issue. Joe vom Titan ( talk ) 21:22, 27 November 2025 (UTC) [ reply ]

Wikimedia file upload wizard 

Shortcut 

- WP:FUW WP:FUW 

Thank you for offering to contribute an image or other media file for use on Wikipedia. This wizard will guide you through a questionnaire prompting you for the appropriate copyright and sourcing information for each file. Please ensure you understand copyright and the image use policy before proceeding. 

Upload your own or a freely-licensed file 

Uploads to Wikimedia Commons 

Upload a non-free file 

Uploads locally to the English Wikipedia; must comply with the non-free content criteria 

You do not have JavaScript enabled 

Sorry, in order to use this uploading script, JavaScript must be enabled. You can still use the plain Special:Upload page to upload files to the English Wikipedia without JavaScript. 

You are not currently logged in. 

Sorry, in order to use this uploading script and to upload files, you need to be logged in with your named account. Please log in and then try again. 

Your account has not become confirmed yet. 

Sorry, in order to upload files on the English Wikipedia, you need to have a confirmed account . Normally, your account will become confirmed automatically once you have made 10 edits and four days have passed since you created it. 

You may already be able to upload files on the Wikimedia Commons , but you can't do it on the English Wikipedia just yet. If the file you want to upload has a free license, please go to Commons and upload it there. 

Important note: if you don't want to wait until you are autoconfirmed, you may ask somebody else to upload a file for you at Wikipedia:Files for upload . 

In very rare cases an administrator may make your account confirmed manually through a request at Wikipedia:Requests for permissions/Confirmed . 

# Step 1: Choose your file 

File: Choose a file from your computer. Maximum file size: 100 MB. Permitted file types: png, gif, jpg, jpeg, xcf, pdf, mid, mp3, mpeg, mpg, ogg, ogv, opus, svg, djvu, tiff, tif, oga, flac, wav, wave, webm, webp. 

# Step 2: Describe your file 

Please provide a clear, descriptive name by which your file will be known on Wikipedia. This name must be unique across the whole of Wikipedia, so please make it informative and easy to recognize. It's no problem to use a fairly long name. It may also include spaces, commas and most other punctuation marks. Please also note that file names are case sensitive (with the exception of the first letter). Good: "City of London, skyline from London City Hall, Oct 2008.jpg". Bad : "Skyline.jpg", "DSC0001234.jpg". 

Sorry, a few special characters and character combinations cannot be used in the filename for technical reasons. This goes especially for # < > [ ] | : { } / and ~~~ . Your filename has been modified to avoid these. Please check if it is okay now. 

The filename you chose seems to be very short, or overly generic. Please don't use: 

- Titles that consist only of very generic descriptive words (e.g. "Sunset.jpg", "Townhall.jpg") 
- Titles that consist only of a person's first or last name, when that name is likely to be shared by many others (e.g. "John.jpg", "Miller.jpg") 
- Titles that consist of mere numbers, of the kind often produced by digital cameras ("DSC_001234", "IMGP0345"), or random strings like those sometimes found on the web ("30996951316264l.jpg") 

Existing file . Last uploaded by Example user . 

A file of this name already exists on Commons! 

If you upload your file with this name, you will be masking the existing file and make it inaccessible. Your new file will be displayed everywhere the existing file was previously used. 

This should not be done, except in very rare exceptional cases. 

Please don't upload your file under this name, unless you seriously know what you are doing. Choose a different name for your new file instead. 
If you want to replace the existing file with an uncontroversial, improved version of the same work, please go to Commons and upload it there, not here on the English Wikipedia's local wiki. 

A file of this name already exists. 

If you upload your file with this name, you will be overwriting the existing file. Your new file will be displayed everywhere the existing file was previously used. Please don't do this, unless you have a good reason to: 
No , I don't want to overwrite the existing file. I will choose a different name for my new file instead. Yes , I want to overwrite the existing file. My file is merely a new, improved and uncontentious version of the same work. The old description page, including the source and copyright information, will still be correct for the new version and can remain the same. Yes , I want to overwrite the existing file, and I will use this wizard to add a new description and new source information for it. The previous version was my own, or else I have made sure the previous uploader(s) don't object to this replacement. 

Please provide a brief description of the contents of this file. This will be stored and displayed as part of the file description page. It is important that other editors are able to understand what this file is about. What does this file show? What is it a photo/diagram/recording of? It will be helpful if you also add a wikilink to the article where you want to use it. 

# Step 3: Provide source and copyright information 

It is very important that you read through the following options and questions, and provide all required information truthfully and carefully. 
This is a free work. I can demonstrate that it is legally okay for anybody to use, in Wikipedia and elsewhere, for any purpose. 

Thank you for offering to upload a free work. 

Wikipedia loves free files. However, we would love it even more if you uploaded them on our sister project, Wikimedia Commons .
Files uploaded on Commons can be used immediately here on Wikipedia as well as on all its sister projects. Uploading files on Commons works just the same as here. Your Wikipedia account will automatically work on Commons too. 

Please consider uploading your file on Commons . 

However, if you prefer to do it here instead, you may go ahead with this form. You can also first use this form to collect the information about your file and then send it to Commons from here. 

Copyright status: This file is entirely my own work. I am the copyright holder. I made this myself, from scratch, without copying or incorporating anybody else's creative work, and I am willing to release it under a free license. 

Please note that by "entirely self-made" we really mean just that. 

Do not use this section for any of the following: 

- a scan or photograph you made of a painting, drawing, printed page or other item originally created by somebody else. The copyright belongs to the original creator, not to you. 
- a screenshot or other kind of capture of a video, computer screen, TV programme or other kind of visual media. 
- a picture you created by modifying or copying some other picture or by combining several preexisting pictures made by somebody else. 
- a picture given to you by somebody else. 
- a picture you found somewhere on the Internet. 

Editors who falsely declare such items as their "own work" will be blocked from editing . 

Please describe how and when you created this item. How? (e.g.: Where and on what kind of occasion did you take this photo? How did you make this diagram? etc.) Date (please use YYYY-MM-DD format if possible). Publication: Please indicate here if you have previously published this item elsewhere, e.g. on your own website, your Flickr or Facebook account, etc., providing a link. It is important that you place this work under a free license, which will allow everybody else to use it for any purpose, including both commercial and non-commercial purposes, and to modify it. This license will be irrevocable. 
This file was given to me by its owner. The copyright owner of this file has given it to me for uploading on Wikipedia. I can provide evidence that they have agreed to release it under a free license, for free use by anybody and for any purpose. 

Please describe who owns this work and how you got it from them. Owner/author: Date of creation: Source: Where did you get the file from? (e.g. available online; was sent to me personally …) Permission: How did you receive the permission? (e.g.: by e-mail, personally, I work for the owner …) The copyright owner has chosen the following license: License: Other: Evidence: The license statement can be found online at: The license agreement has been forwarded to Wikimedia's volunteer response team at "permissions-en@wikimedia.org". OTRS ticket received: The license hasn't yet been forwarded, but I will do so shortly or ask the owner to send it. I haven't got the evidence right now, but I will provide some if requested to do so. Note: files without verifiable permissions may be deleted. You may be better off obtaining proof of permission first. 
This file is from a free published source. I took it from a website or other published source, where its author has explicitly placed it under a free license, allowing free re-use by anybody. 

Use this only if there is an explicit licensing statement in the source. 

The website must explicitly say that the image is released under a license that allows free re-use for any purpose, e.g. the Creative Commons Attribution license. You must be able to point exactly to where it says this. 

If the source website doesn't say so explicitly, please do not upload the file . 

Author/owner: Date of creation: Source: For web sources: please provide a link to the html web page where the file can be found ("http://... .html"), not a direct link to the image file itself ("http://... .jpg"). For print sources: provide full bibliographic information (author, title, publisher, year, page, etc.) The copyright owner has chosen the following license for this file: License: Other: Evidence: Provide a link to where the author explicitly says that the file is released under a free license. (if not visible on the source page itself). 
This work is so old its copyright has expired This is an old photograph, or a photographic reproduction of an old painting, drawing, etc. I can provide enough information about its author and provenance to prove that it is old enough for its copyright to have expired. It is now legally in the Public Domain . 

Original author: Please name the original author of this work. Lifetime: Specify date of death, if applicable to public domain status. In many cases, we need to be certain the author died before a certain year, in many cases before 1930. Original publication: Provide as much information as possible about the original time and place of publication of this work. For print publications: provide full bibliographic information. Date of publication: Provide date of first publication, and date of creation if different. Immediate source: State exactly where you found this file. For web sources: please provide a link to the html web page where the file can be found ("http://... .html"), not a direct link to the image file itself ("http://... .jpg"). For print sources: provide full bibliographic information (author, title, publisher, year, page, etc.) Public Domain status: This work is free of all copyrights because: It was created and first published before 1930 and is therefore in the Public Domain in the US. It was first published outside the US , and it was in the Public Domain in its country of origin by the " URAA date ". For most countries, this means the author died 70 years before 1 January 1996, i.e. before 1926. Please look up the copyright rules for the specific country at [1] . It was first published in the US before 1989 , and its copyright expired because it was published without a copyright notice and/or without the necessary copyright registration. Please look up the exact rules at [2] . Its copyright expired for some other reason. [Please explain below]. Explanation: Please provide any evidence necessary to verify the public domain status. 
This file is in the Public Domain for some other reason. I can demonstrate that this work is legally in the Public Domain, i.e. nobody owns any copyrights on it. This may be for a variety of reasons, for instance because it was created by the US Federal Government, or because it is too simple to attract any copyright. 

Public Domain means that nobody owns any copyrights on this work. It does not mean simply that it is freely viewable somewhere on the web or that it has been widely used by others. 

This is not for images you simply found somewhere on the web. Most images on the web are under copyright and belong to somebody, even if you believe the owner won't care about that copyright. If it is in the public domain, you must be able to point to an actual law that makes it so. If you can't point to such a law but merely found this image somewhere, then please do not upload it. 

Author: Please name the original author of this work. Source: State exactly where you found this file. For web sources: please provide a link to the html web page where the file can be found ("http://... .html"), not a direct link to the image file itself ("http://... .jpg"). For print sources: provide full bibliographic information (author, title, publisher, year, page, etc.) Date of creation: Public Domain status: This work is free of all copyrights because: It was created by an agency of the US Federal Government. This does not apply to most US state and local agencies , nor to governments of other countries! It is an official governmental item, such as a flag, state emblem, banknote or postage stamp, from a country where such items are exempt from copyright according to local law. This does not apply to all countries, nor does it usually apply to all publications! (For instance, it usually doesn't apply to simple publicity photographs published on a governmental website.)  Please look up the copyright rules for the specific country in question. If the country does not have an exemption rule that applies to this item, go on with the section for " non-free copyrighted works " below. Explanation: Add any explanation or evidence necessary to substantiate your statement above. Cite and provide a link to the relevant law if possible. It is too simple to be eligible for copyright. This typically applies only to graphics that consist solely of simple geometric shapes and/or a few letters or words, or to items such as mathematical or chemical formulae. It may apply to some very simple logos that do not contain complex pictorial elements. It never applies to photographs! It is in the Public Domain for some other reason. Explanation: 

This is a copyrighted, non-free work, but I believe it is Fair Use. I have read the Wikipedia rules on Non-Free Content , and I am prepared to explain how the use of this file will meet the criteria set out there. 

Please remember that you will need to demonstrate that: 

- The file will serve an important function in a particular article; ( NFCC8 ) 
- It cannot be replaced by any other, free illustration that might yet be created; ( NFCC1 ) 
- Its use does not negatively affect the commercial interests of its owner ( NFCC2 ) 
- There will not be more non-free material used than necessary. ( NFCC3 ) 

This file will be used in the following article: 

Enter the name of exactly one Wikipedia article, without the [[...]] brackets and without the "http://en.wikipedia.org/..." URL code. It has to be an actual article, not a talkpage, template, user page, etc. If you plan to use the file in more than one article, please name only one of them here. Then, after uploading, open the image description page for editing and add your separate explanations for each additional article manually. 

Example – article okay. 

This article doesn't exist! 

The article Example could not be found. 

Please check the spelling, and make sure you enter the name of an existing article in which you will include this file. 

If this is an article you are only planning to write, please write it first and upload the file afterwards. 

This is not an actual encyclopedia article! 

The page Example is not in the main article namespace. Non-free files can only be used in mainspace article pages, not on a user page, talk page, template, etc. 

Please upload this file only if it is going to be used in an actual article. 

If this page is an article draft in your user space, we're sorry, but we must ask you to wait until the page is ready and has been moved into mainspace, and only upload the file after that. 

This is a disambiguation page! 

The page Example is not a real article, but a disambiguation page pointing to a number of other pages. 

Please check and enter the exact title of the actual target article you meant. 

Non-free use rationale This image is the object of discussion in an article. This is a copyrighted artwork or photograph, and the image itself is the topic of discussion in the article. The discussion is about the photograph or painting as such, as a creative work, not just about the thing or person it shows. 

Which of these options describes this item best? Who created this work? Author/owner: Date: Source: State exactly where you found this file. For web sources: please provide a link to the html web page where the file can be found ("http://... .html"), not a direct link to the image file itself ("http://... .jpg"). For print sources: provide full bibliographic information (author, title, publisher, year, page, etc.) Usage: The article as a whole is dedicated specifically to a discussion of this particular photograph/painting. (It is not just about the person or thing shown in the picture.) There is a substantial amount of encyclopedic discussion of this particular photograph/painting ( not just about the person or thing shown in it) in this article. The illustration is specifically needed to support the following point: 

If neither of these two statements applies, then please do not upload this image. 

This section is not for images used merely to illustrate an article about a person or thing, showing what that person or thing look like. 

This is a depiction of a copyrighted three-dimensional work or building , which is the object of discussion in an article. This is a photograph or other kind of depiction of a copyrighted, three-dimensional creative work, such as a statue or work of architecture. The article contains a discussion of that work which requires illustration. The photograph as such is free, or was provided by the creator of the sculpture. 

Which of these options describes this item best? First describe who created the original work depicted: Creator: Date: Usage: The article as a whole is dedicated specifically to this work. There is a substantial amount of encyclopedic discussion of this work in this article. The illustration is specifically needed to support the following point: Now describe who created the image : Author: Date: Source: State exactly where you found this file. For web sources: please provide a link to the html web page where the file can be found ("http://... .html"), not a direct link to the image file itself ("http://... .jpg"). For print sources: provide full bibliographic information (author, title, publisher, year, page, etc.) Image status The image was created and published by the same author who also holds the rights to the original object, and no alternative depiction could be suitably created. The author of the image has released the photographic work under a free license, or it is in the public domain: Name the license or describe the public domain status, adding any necessary evidence to make the licensing status verifiable. 
This is an excerpt from a copyrighted work . This is an excerpt from a copyrighted work, e.g. a screenshot from a movie or TV programme, a panel from a comic, or a sound sample from a song. Its presence is needed to support a piece of explicit critical discussion in an article related to that work or its creator(s). 

Which of these options describes this item best? Author: (author / copyright owner of the original work) Date of creation: Source: (where exactly did you get this file from?) Please explain what exactly in the article it is that you want to illustrate with this. Typically, the illustration must be used to support some specific issue of discussion in the article. Please be concrete and specific. Don't just copy boilerplate statements from elsewhere. State clearly, in your own words, what this particular file will be doing in this particular article. If necessary, please explain why this purpose cannot be achieved through text alone. 
This is the official cover art of a work. This is the cover or dustjacket of a book, the cover of a CD or video, the official release poster of a movie, or a comparable item. It will be included as that work's primary means of visual identification, at the top of the article about the book, movie, etc. in question. Note: If you plan to use it for any other purpose than this, please tick the box for "other non-free work" below. 

Which of these options describes this item best? Author: (author / copyright owner of the original work) Date of publication: Source: (where exactly did you get this file from?) This image will be shown as a primary means of visual identification at the top of the article dedicated to the work in question. A standard fair use rationale will be added that matches this type of use. If you plan to use the file for any purpose other than this, please do not use this section, but the one labelled "other type of non-free work" below. 
This is a logo of an organization , company, brand, etc. This is an official logo of an entity that is the subject of a Wikipedia article. It will be included as that entity's primary means of visual identification, at the top of the article in question. Note: If you plan to use it for any other purpose than this, please tick the box for "other non-free work" below. 

Which of these options describes this item best? Source: (where exactly did you get this file from?) This image will be shown as a primary means of visual identification at the top of the article dedicated to the entity in question. A standard fair use rationale will be added that matches this type of use. If you plan to use the file for any purpose other than this, please do not use this section, but the one labelled "other type of non-free work" below. 
This is a historical portrait of a person no longer alive. This is a historical photograph or other depiction of a person who is no longer alive. It will be used as the primary means of visual identification of that person in the article about them. 

Deceased since: (This type of file can typically only be used with people who are no longer alive.) Author: (Who made this image?) Original publication: (Where, when and how was this image first published?) Date of publication: Source: (Where exactly did you get this file from?) This image will be shown as a primary means of visual identification at the top of the article dedicated to the person in question. A standard fair use rationale will be added that matches this type of use. If you plan to use the file for any purpose other than this, please do not use this section, but the one labelled "other type of non-free work" below. Please explain why a free alternative to this image cannot be found. For subjects who died recently: have you made a reasonable effort to find people who might possess photographs of this person and might be willing to release one? For subjects who lived in the early-to-mid 20th century: have you considered if there might be an older photograph that has fallen in the public domain? Please explain why you are confident that our use of the file will not harm any commercial opportunities of its owner. We will typically not use a file if its owner has a potential commercial interest in its use, and if our use of it would compete with its original market role. 
This is some other kind of non-free work that I believe is legitimate Fair Use. This is a copyrighted work whose use does not fall into any of the classes above. I have read the Wikipedia rules on Non-free content , and I will explain how this file meets all of the criteria set out there. 

Which of these options describes this item best? Author: (Who made this image?) Original publication: (Where, when and how was this image first published?) Date of publication: Source: (Where exactly did you get this file from?) Please explain what exact purpose this file will serve in the article. Please be concrete and specific. Don't just copy boilerplate statements from elsewhere. State clearly, in your own words, what this particular file will be doing in this particular article. Your explanation must make it clear why the article would be significantly worse off without this file. Please explain why this purpose could not be served by text alone. Please explain why this purpose could not be served with an alternative, free illustration that could yet be found or created. For a file to be deemed replaceable, it is not necessary that a suitable replacement already exists. Even if it is merely possible that a replacement could be created, we will not use the non-free file. Please explain why you are confident that our use of the file will not harm any commercial opportunities of its owner. We will typically not use a file if its owner has a potential commercial interest in its use, and if our use of it would compete with its original market role. Remember that the use of non-free files must be minimal. This can mean several things: 

- Don't use more files per article/topic than necessary 
- Don't use the same file in more articles than necessary 
- Don't use larger excerpts of a single work than necessary 
- Don't use images of higher resolution than necessary 

In view of this, please explain how the use of this file will be minimal. 
Special source and license conditions (optional) Any further relevant information about this file? 

Edit summary: A brief description of why you are overwriting this file. This will not be saved on the description page, but will be shown in its edit history. 

Yes , I want this file to be immediately available in all Wikimedia projects, in all languages. I will upload it on the Wikimedia Commons . Clicking this button will redirect you to a page on Commons. This will only work if you are already logged in there, which is likely the case if you have a unified account . Check here to see if you are logged in. 
No , I want to upload this file locally. This way it can be used only on the English Wikipedia. We urge you to upload it to the Commons unless there is a very good reason for it to stay local. Often such local files are copied to the Commons for use elsewhere and deleted locally, requiring extra work for other volunteers. If you do not want your file to be copied to Commons and deleted locally, consider adding the {{ Keep local }} tag. Reset this form and start over. 

This file doesn't fit either of the categories above. This file doesn't seem to fall into either of the classes above, or I am not certain what its status is. I found this file somewhere, but I don't really know who made it or who owns it. 

Well, we're very sorry, but if you're not sure about this file's copyright status, or if it doesn't fit into any of the groups above, then: 

Please don't upload it. 

Really, please don't. Even if you think it would make for a great addition to an article. We really take these copyright rules very seriously on Wikipedia. Note that media is assumed to be fully-copyrighted unless shown otherwise; the burden is on the uploader. 

In particular, please don't upload: 

- any file you simply found on some website, without knowing who its author or copyright owner is. 
- any file you found somewhere, even if you have good reason to believe it has a copyright owner who would not mind us using it, but you don't have an explicit licensing statement from them. 
- any file that was released for publicity purposes by its owners but doesn't have a fully-free license for free re-use for all purposes. 
- any file credited to a commercial image agency, such as Reuters, AP or Getty Images. Such files normally cannot be used even under the "Fair Use" rules, except in rare cases. 
- any file that is licensed for use exclusively on Wikipedia, or is free except that the free license excludes commercial use. 

If you are in any doubt, please ask some experienced editors for advice before uploading. People will be happy to assist you at Wikipedia:Media copyright questions . Thank you.

Good articles in Wikipedia 

A good article (GA) is a Wikipedia article that meets a core set of editorial standards, the good article criteria , passing through the good article nomination process successfully. They are well-written, contain factually accurate and verifiable information, are broad in coverage, neutral in point of view , stable, and illustrated, where possible, by relevant images with suitable copyright licenses . Good articles do not have to be as comprehensive as featured articles (FA), but they should not omit any major facets: a comparison of the criteria for good and featured articles describes further differences. 

Out of the 7,106,875 articles on Wikipedia, 43,072 are categorized as good articles (about 0.61% or one in 165), which are listed below. An additional 6,834 are listed as featured articles (about 1 in 1,040) and 4,730 as featured lists (about 1 in 1,510). Because articles are only included in one category, a good article that has been promoted to featured status is removed from the good articles category. Adding good and featured articles and lists together gives a total of 54,636 articles (about 0.77% or one in 131). A small green icon of a plus sign inside a circle ( ) appears in the top-right corner of the article indicating that the article is good. 

Any significant contributor may nominate an article if they believe it meets the good article criteria . Any impartial editor may review the article from the queue of good article nominations . If it meets the criteria, it is added to the list of good articles below. There are instructions for nominators and reviewers . Similarly, anyone who believes that an article no longer meets the good article criteria may propose to delist it by following the instructions for reassessment .

Felidae ( / ˈ f iː l ə ˌ d iː / FEE -lə-dee [ 3 ] ) is the family of mammals in the order Carnivora colloquially referred to as cats . A member of this family is also called a felid ( / ˈ f iː l ɪ d , - l ə d / FEE -lid, -⁠ləd [ 4 ] [ 5 ] ). [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] 

The 41 extant Felidae species exhibit the greatest diversity in fur patterns of all terrestrial carnivores. [ 10 ] Cats have retractile claws, slender muscular bodies and strong flexible forelimbs. Their teeth and facial muscles allow for a powerful bite. They are all obligate carnivores , and most are solitary predators ambushing or stalking their prey. Wild cats occur in Africa, Europe, Asia and the Americas. Some wild cat species are adapted to forest and savanna habitats, some to arid environments, and a few also to wetlands and mountainous terrain. Their activity patterns range from nocturnal and crepuscular to diurnal , depending on their preferred prey species. [ 11 ] 

Reginald Innes Pocock divided the extant Felidae into three subfamilies: the Pantherinae , the Felinae and the Acinonychinae , differing from each other by the ossification of the hyoid apparatus and by the cutaneous sheaths which protect their claws. [ 12 ] This concept has been revised following developments in molecular biology and techniques for the analysis of morphological data. Today, the living Felidae are divided into two subfamilies: the Pantherinae and Felinae, with the Acinonychinae subsumed into the latter. Pantherinae includes five Panthera and two Neofelis species , while Felinae includes the other 34 species in 12 genera . [ 13 ] 

The first cats emerged during the Oligocene about 25 million years ago , with the appearance of Proailurus and Pseudaelurus . The latter species complex was ancestral to two main lines of felids: the cats in the extant subfamilies, and the "saber-toothed cats" of the extinct subfamily Machairodontinae , including the famous saber-toothed tiger . 

The "false saber-toothed cats", the Barbourofelidae and Nimravidae , are not true cats but are closely related. Together with the Felidae, Viverridae , Nandiniidae , Eupleridae , hyenas and mongooses , they constitute the Feliformia . [ 14 ]

Domestic cat purring Domestic cat meowing Lion roaring Extended claws of a house cat Lionesses grooming each other 

All members of the cat family have the following characteristics in common: 

- They are digitigrade and have five toes on their forefeet and four on their hind feet. Their curved claws are protractile and attached to the terminal bones of the toe with ligaments and tendons . The claws are guarded by cutaneous sheaths, except in the Acinonyx . [ 15 ] 
- The plantar pads of both fore and hind feet form compact three-lobed cushions. [ 16 ] 
- They actively protract the claws by contracting muscles in the toe, [ 11 ] and they passively retract them. The dewclaws are expanded but do not protract. [ 17 ] 
- They have lithe and flexible bodies with muscular limbs. [ 11 ] 
- Their skulls are foreshortened with a rounded profile and large orbits. [ 17 ] 
- They have 30 teeth with a dental formula of 3.1.3.1 3.1.2.1 . The upper third premolar and lower molar are adapted as carnassial teeth, suited to tearing and cutting flesh. [ 16 ] The canine teeth are large, reaching exceptional size in the extinct Machairodontinae . The lower carnassial is smaller than the upper carnassial and has a crown with two compressed blade-like pointed cusps. [ 11 ] 
- Their tongues are covered with horn-like papillae , which rasp meat from prey and aid in grooming. [ 17 ] 
- Their noses project slightly beyond the lower jaw. [ 15 ] 
- Their eyes are relatively large, situated to provide binocular vision . Their night vision is especially good due to the presence of a tapetum lucidum , which reflects light inside the eyeball, and gives felid eyes their distinctive shine. As a result, the eyes of felids are about six times more light-sensitive than those of humans, and many species are at least partially nocturnal . The retina of felids also contains a relatively high proportion of rod cells , adapted for distinguishing moving objects in conditions of dim light, which are complemented by the presence of cone cells for sensing colour during the day. [ 11 ] 
- They have well-developed and highly sensitive whiskers above the eyes, on the cheeks, and the muzzle, but not below the chin. [ 15 ] Whiskers help to navigate in the dark and to capture and hold prey. [ 17 ] 
- Their external ears are large and especially sensitive to high-frequency sounds in the smaller cat species. This sensitivity allows them to locate small rodent prey. [ 11 ] 
- The penis is subconical, [ 15 ] facing downward when not erect [ 18 ] and backward during urination. [ 19 ] The baculum is small or vestigial, and shorter than in the Canidae . [ 18 ] [ 20 ] Most felids have penile spines that induce ovulation during copulation . [ 21 ] 
- They have a vomeronasal organ in the roof of the mouth, allowing them to "taste" the air. [ 22 ] The use of this organ is associated with the flehmen response . [ 23 ] 
- They cannot detect the sweetness of sugar, as they lack the sweet taste receptor. [ 24 ] 
- They share a broadly similar set of vocalizations but with some variation between species. In particular, the pitch of calls varies, with larger species producing deeper sounds; overall, the frequency of felid calls ranges between 50 and 10,000 hertz. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] The standard sounds made by felids include mewing, chuffing, spitting, hissing, snarling and growling. Mewing and chuffing are the main contact sound, whereas the others signify an aggressive motivation. [ 11 ] 
- They can purr during both phases of respiration , though pantherine cats seem to purr only during oestrus and copulation, and as cubs when suckling. Purring is generally a low-pitch sound of 16.8–27.5 Hz and is mixed with other vocalization types during the expiratory phase. [ 27 ] The ability to roar comes from an elongated and specially adapted larynx and hyoid apparatus . [ 28 ] When air passes through the larynx on the way from the lungs, the cartilage walls of the larynx vibrate, producing sound. Only lions, leopards, tigers, and jaguars are truly able to roar, although the loudest mews of snow leopards have a similar, if less structured, sound. [ 11 ] Clouded leopards can neither purr nor roar, and so Neofelis is said to be a sister group to Panthera . Sabre-toothed cats may have had the ability to both roar and purr. 

The colour, length and density of their fur are very diverse. Fur colour covers the gamut from white to black, and fur patterns from distinctive small spots, and stripes to small blotches and rosettes . Most cat species are born with spotted fur, except the jaguarundi ( Herpailurus yagouaroundi ), Asian golden cat ( Catopuma temminckii ) and caracal ( Caracal caracal ). The spotted fur of lion ( Panthera leo ), cheetah ( Acinonyx jubatus ) and cougar ( Puma concolor ) cubs change to uniform fur during their development to adulthood . [ 10 ] Those living in cold environments have thick fur with long hair, like the snow leopard ( Panthera uncia ) and the Pallas's cat ( Otocolobus manul ). [ 17 ] Those living in tropical and hot climate zones have short fur. [ 11 ] Several species exhibit melanism with all-black individuals, cougars are notable for lacking melanism but leucism and albinism are present in cougars along with many other felids. [ 29 ] 

In the great majority of cat species, the tail is between a third and a half of the body length, although with some exceptions, like the Lynx species and margay ( Leopardus wiedii ). [ 11 ] Cat species vary greatly in body and skull sizes, and weights: 

- The largest cat species is the tiger ( Panthera tigris ), with a head-to-body length of up to 390 cm (150 in), a weight range of at least 65 to 325 kg (143 to 717 lb), and a skull length ranging from 316 to 413 mm (12.4 to 16.3 in). [ 11 ] [ 30 ] Although the maximum skull length of a lion is slightly greater at 419 mm (16.5 in), it is generally smaller in head-to-body length than the tiger. [ 31 ] 
- The smallest cat species are the rusty-spotted cat ( Prionailurus rubiginosus ) and the black-footed cat ( Felis nigripes ). The former is 35–48 cm (14–19 in) in length and weighs 0.9–1.6 kg (2.0–3.5 lb). [ 11 ] The latter has a head-to-body length of 36.7–43.3 cm (14.4–17.0 in) and a maximum recorded weight of 2.45 kg (5.4 lb). [ 32 ] [ 33 ] 

Most cat species have a haploid number of 18 or 19. Central and South American cats have a haploid number of 18, possibly due to the combination of two smaller chromosomes into a larger one. [ 34 ] 

Felidae species have type IIx muscle fibers three times more powerful than the muscle fibers of human athletes. [ 35 ]

The family Felidae is part of the Feliformia , a suborder that diverged probably about 50.6 to 35 million years ago into several families. [ 36 ] The Felidae and the Asiatic linsangs are considered a sister group , which split about 35.2 to 31.9 million years ago . [ 37 ] 

The earliest cats probably appeared about 35 to 28.5 million years ago . Proailurus is the oldest known cat that occurred after the Eocene–Oligocene extinction event about 33.9 million years ago ; fossil remains were excavated in France and Mongolia's Hsanda Gol Formation . [ 14 ] Fossil occurrences indicate that the Felidae arrived in North America around 18.5 million years ago . This is about 20 million years later than the bears and the false saber-tooth cats , and about 10 million years later than the canines . [ 38 ] 

In the Early Miocene about 20 to 16.6 million years ago , Pseudaelurus lived in Africa. Its fossil jaws were also excavated in geological formations of Europe's Vallesian , Asia's Middle Miocene and North America's late Hemingfordian to late Barstovian epochs. [ 39 ] Modelling of felid coat pattern transformations revealed that nearly all patterns evolved from small spots. [ 40 ] 

During the Middle Miocene around 15 million years ago, the extinct subfamily Machairodontinae (colloquially known as "saber-toothed cats") emerged and became widespread across Afro-Eurasia and North America by the Late Miocene. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] With their large upper canine saber teeth , they were adapted to prey on large-bodied megaherbivores . [ 43 ] [ 44 ] During the Late Miocene and early Pliocene, machairodontines were the dominant cats and large mammalian predators across Afro-Eurasia and North America, with ancestors of living cats generally being small at this time. [ 42 ] 

The earliest members of the living cat lineages are known from the Middle Miocene, [ 45 ] with the last common ancestor of living cats estimated to have lived around 16 million years ago. [ 46 ] Large sized felines and pantherines only emerged during the Pliocene epoch, [ 47 ] including the modern big cat genus Panthera . [ 48 ] Felids entered South America as part of the Great American Interchange following the emergence of the Isthmus of Panama during the Pliocene epoch. [ 49 ] 

Machairodontines began to decline during the Pleistocene , perhaps as a result of environmental change and consequential changes in prey abundance, competition with large living cat lineages such as the pantherins as well as possibly archaic humans . The last species belonging to the genera Smilodon and Homotherium became extinct along with many other large mammals around 12–10,000 years ago as part of the end-Pleistocene extinction event , following human arrival to the Americas at the end of the Late Pleistocene. [ 50 ] 

# Classification 
[ edit ] 

Traditionally, five subfamilies had been distinguished within the Felidae based on phenotypical features: the Pantherinae , the Felinae , the Acinonychinae, [ 12 ] and the extinct Machairodontinae and Proailurinae . [ 51 ] Acinonychinae used to only contain the genus Acinonyx but this genus is now within the Felinae subfamily. [ 13 ]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 

(Redirected from Megaannum ) 

Unit of time based on orbit of Earth 

"Years" redirects here. For other uses, see Years (disambiguation) . 

"12 months" redirects here. For other uses, see The Twelve Months (disambiguation) . 
An animation of the inner Solar System planets' orbit around the Sun. The duration of the year is the time taken to go around the Sun. 

A year is a unit of time based on how long it takes the Earth to orbit the Sun . [ 1 ] In scientific use, the tropical year (approximately 365 solar days , 5 hours, 48 minutes, 45 seconds) and the sidereal year (about 20 minutes longer) are more exact. The modern calendar year , as reckoned according to the Gregorian calendar , approximates the tropical year by using a system of leap years . 

The term 'year' is also used to indicate other periods of roughly similar duration, such as the lunar year (a roughly 354-day cycle of twelve of the Moon's phases – see lunar calendar ), as well as periods loosely associated with the calendar or astronomical year, such as the seasonal year , the fiscal year , the academic year , etc. 

Due to the Earth's axial tilt , the course of a year sees the passing of the seasons , marked by changes in weather , the hours of daylight , and, consequently, vegetation and soil fertility . In temperate and subpolar regions around the planet, four seasons are generally recognized: spring , summer , autumn , and winter . In tropical and subtropical regions, several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons; but in the seasonal tropics , the annual wet and dry seasons are recognized and tracked. 

By extension, the term 'year' can also be applied to the time taken for the orbit of any astronomical object around its primary –  for example the Martian year of roughly 1.88 Earth years. 

The term can also be used in reference to any long period or cycle, such as the Great Year . [ 2 ] 

# Calendar year 

A calendar year is an approximation of the number of days of the Earth's orbital period, as counted in a given calendar . The Gregorian calendar , or modern calendar, presents its calendar year to be either a common year of 365 days or a leap year of 366 days, as do the Julian calendars . For the Gregorian calendar, the average length of the calendar year (the mean year) across the complete leap cycle of 400 years is 365.2425 days (97 out of 400 years are leap years). [ 3 ] 

# Abbreviation 

In English, the unit of time for year is commonly abbreviated as "y" or "yr". The symbol "a" (for Latin : annus , year) is sometimes used in scientific literature, though its exact duration may be inconsistent. [ citation needed ] 

# Etymology 

English year (via West Saxon ġēar ( /jɛar/ ), Anglian ġēr ) continues Proto-Germanic *jǣran ( *j ē₁ ran ). Cognates are German Jahr , Old High German jār , Old Norse ár and Gothic jer , from the Proto-Indo-European noun * *yeh₁r-om "year, season". Cognates also descended from the same Proto-Indo-European noun (with variation in suffix ablaut ) are Avestan yārǝ "year", Greek ὥρα ( hṓra ) "year, season, period of time" (whence " hour "), Old Church Slavonic jarŭ , and Latin hornus "of this year". [ citation needed ] 

Latin annus (a 2nd declension masculine noun; annum is the accusative singular ; annī is genitive singular and nominative plural; annō the dative and ablative singular) is from a PIE noun * h₂et-no- , which also yielded Gothic aþn "year" (only the dative plural aþnam is attested). 

Although most languages treat the word as thematic *yeh₁r-o- , there is evidence for an original derivation with an *-r/n suffix, *yeh₁-ro- . Both Indo-European words for year, *yeh₁-ro- and *h₂et-no- , would then be derived from verbal roots meaning "to go, move", *h₁ey- and *h₂et- , respectively (compare Vedic Sanskrit éti "goes", atasi "thou goest, wanderest"). A number of English words are derived from Latin annus , such as annual , annuity , anniversary , etc.; per annum means "each year", annō Dominī means "in the year of the Lord". 

The Greek word for "year", ἔτος , is cognate with Latin vetus "old", from the PIE word *wetos- "year", also preserved in this meaning in Sanskrit vat-sa-ras "year" and vat-sa- "yearling (calf)", the latter also reflected in Latin vitulus "bull calf", English wether "ram" (Old English weðer , Gothic wiþrus "lamb"). 

In some languages, it is common to count years by referencing to one season, as in "summers", or "winters", or "harvests". Examples include Chinese 年 "year", originally 秂 , an ideographic compound of a person carrying a bundle of wheat denoting "harvest". Slavic besides godŭ "time period; year" uses lěto "summer; year". 

# Intercalation 

Astronomical years do not have an integer number of days or lunar months. Any calendar that follows an astronomical year must have a system of intercalation such as leap years. 

# Julian calendar 

In the Julian calendar , the average (mean) length of a year is 365.25 days. In a non-leap year, there are 365 days, in a leap year there are 366 days. A leap year occurs every fourth year during which a leap day is intercalated into the month of February. The name "Leap Day" is applied to the added day. 

In astronomy, the Julian year is a unit of time defined as 365.25 days, each of exactly 86 400 seconds ( SI base unit ), totaling exactly 31,557,600 seconds in the Julian astronomical year. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] 

# Revised Julian calendar 

The Revised Julian calendar , proposed in 1923 and used in some Eastern Orthodox Churches , has 218 leap years every 900 years, for the average (mean) year length of 365.242 2222 days, close to the length of the mean tropical year, 365.242 19 days (relative error of 9·10). In the year 2800 CE, the Gregorian and Revised Julian calendars will begin to differ by one calendar day. [ 6 ] 

# Gregorian calendar 

The Gregorian calendar aims to ensure that the northward equinox falls on or shortly before March 21 and hence it follows the northward equinox year , or tropical year . [ 7 ] Because 97 out of 400 years are leap years, the mean length of the Gregorian calendar year is 365.2425 days; with a relative error below one ppm (8·10) relative to the current length of the mean tropical year ( 365.242 189 days) and even closer to the current March equinox year of 365.242 374 days that it aims to match. 

# Other calendars 

Further information: Lunisolar calendar 

Historically, lunisolar calendars intercalated entire leap months on an observational basis. Lunisolar calendars have mostly fallen out of use except for liturgical reasons ( Hebrew calendar , various Hindu calendars ). 

A modern adaptation of the historical Jalali calendar , known as the Solar Hijri calendar (1925), is a purely solar calendar with an irregular pattern of leap days based on observation (or astronomical computation), aiming to place new year ( Nowruz ) on the day of vernal equinox (for the time zone of Tehran ), as opposed to using an algorithmic system of leap years. 

# Year numbering 

A calendar era assigns a cardinal number to each sequential year, using a reference event in the past (called the epoch ) as the beginning of the era. 

The Gregorian calendar era is the world's most widely used civil calendar . [ 8 ] Its epoch is a 6th century estimate of the date of birth of Jesus of Nazareth . Two notations are used to indicate year numbering in the Gregorian calendar: the Christian " Anno Domini " (meaning "in the year of the Lord"), abbreviated AD; and " Common Era ", abbreviated CE, preferred by many of other faiths and none.  Year numbers are based on inclusive counting , so that there is no "year zero".  Years before the epoch are abbreviated BC for Before Christ or BCE for Before the Common Era . In Astronomical year numbering , positive numbers indicate years AD/CE, the number 0 designates 1 BC/BCE, −1 designates 2 BC/BCE, and so on. 

Other eras include that of Ancient Rome , Ab Urbe Condita ("from the foundation of the city ), abbreviated AUC; Anno Mundi ("year of the world"), used for the Hebrew calendar and abbreviated AM; and the Japanese imperial eras . The Islamic Hijri year , (year of the Hijrah , Anno Hegirae abbreviated AH), is a lunar calendar of twelve lunar months and thus is shorter than a solar year. 

# Pragmatic divisions 

Financial and scientific calculations often use a 365-day calendar to simplify daily rates. 

# Fiscal year 

Main article: Fiscal year 

A fiscal year or financial year is a 12-month period used for calculating annual financial statements in businesses and other organizations. In many jurisdictions, regulations regarding accounting require such reports once per twelve months, but do not require that the twelve months constitute a calendar year. 

For example, in Canada and India the fiscal year runs from April 1; in the United Kingdom it runs from April 1 for purposes of corporation tax and government financial statements, but from April 6 for purposes of personal taxation and payment of state benefits; in Australia it runs from July 1; while in the United States the fiscal year of the federal government runs from October 1. 

# Academic year 

Main article: Academic year 

An academic year is the annual period during which a student attends an educational institution . The academic year may be divided into academic terms , such as semesters or quarters. The school year in many countries in the Northern Hemisphere starts in August or September and ends in May, June or July, providing a summer break from study between academic years. In Israel the academic year begins around October or November, aligned with the second month of the Hebrew calendar. 

Some schools in the UK, Canada and the United States divide the academic year into three roughly equal-length terms (called trimesters or quarters in the United States), roughly coinciding with autumn, winter, and spring. At some, a shortened summer session, sometimes considered part of the regular academic year, is attended by students on a voluntary or elective basis. Other schools break the year into two main semesters, a first (typically August through December) and a second semester (January through May). Each of these main semesters may be split in half by mid-term exams, and each of the halves is referred to as a quarter (or term in some countries). There may also be a voluntary summer session or a short January session. 

Some other schools, including some in the United States, have four marking periods. Some schools in the United States, notably Boston Latin School , may divide the year into five or more marking periods. Some state in defense of this that there is perhaps a positive correlation between report frequency and academic achievement. 

There are typically 180 days of teaching each year in schools in the US, excluding weekends and breaks, while there are 190 days for pupils in state schools in Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and 200 for pupils in Australia. [ citation needed ] 

In India the academic year normally starts from June 1 and ends on May 31. Though schools start closing from mid-March, the actual academic closure is on May 31 and in Nepal it starts from July 15. [ citation needed ] 

Schools and universities in Australia typically have academic years that roughly align with the calendar year (i.e., starting in February or March and ending in October to December), as the southern hemisphere experiences summer from December to February. 

# Astronomical years 

See also: Astronomical month 

# Julian year 

Main article: Julian year (astronomy) 

The Julian year, as used in astronomy and other sciences, is a time unit now defined as exactly 365.25 days of 86 400 SI seconds each [ 9 ] (" ephemeris days "). This is one meaning of the unit "year" used in various scientific contexts. The Julian century of 36 525 ephemeris days and the Julian millennium of 365 250 ephemeris days are used in astronomical calculations. Fundamentally, expressing a time interval in Julian years is a way to precisely specify an amount of time (not how many "real" years), for long time intervals where stating the number of ephemeris days would be unwieldy and unintuitive. By convention, the Julian year is used in the computation of the distance covered by a light-year . 

In the Unified Code for Units of Measure (but not according to the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics or the International Union of Geological Sciences , see below), the symbol 'a' (without subscript) always refers to the Julian year, 'a j ', of exactly 31 557 600 seconds . 
365.25 d × 86 400 s = 1 a = 1 a j = 31.5576 Ms 

The SI multiplier prefixes may be applied to it to form "ka", "Ma", etc. [ 10 ] 

The scientific Julian year is not to be confused with a year in the Jullian calendar. The scientific Julian year is a multiple of the SI second; it is today "astronomical" only in the sense "used in astronomy", whilst true astronomical years are based on the movements of celestial bodies. 

# Sidereal, tropical, and anomalistic years 

Main articles: Sidereal year and Tropical year 

The relations among these are considered more fully in Axial precession (astronomy) . 

Each of these three years can be loosely called an astronomical year . 

The sidereal year is the time taken for the Earth to complete one revolution of its orbit , as measured against a fixed frame of reference (such as the fixed stars, Latin sidera , singular sidus ). Its average duration is 365.256 363 004 days (365 d 6 h 9 min 9.76 s) (at the epoch J2000.0 = January 1, 2000, 12:00:00 TT ). [ 11 ] 

Today the mean tropical year is defined as the period of time for the mean ecliptic longitude of the Sun to increase by 360 degrees. [ 12 ] Since the Sun's ecliptic longitude is measured with respect to the equinox, [ 13 ] the tropical year comprises a complete cycle of the seasons and is the basis of solar calendars such as the internationally used Gregorian calendar . The modern definition of mean tropical year differs from the actual time between passages of, e.g., the northward equinox, by a minute or two, for several reasons explained below. Because of the Earth's axial precession , this year is about 20 minutes shorter than the sidereal year. The mean tropical year is approximately 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 45 seconds, using the modern definition [ 14 ] (= 365.242 1875 d × 86 400 s = 31 556 925 s ). The length of the tropical year varies a bit over thousands of years because the rate of axial precession is not constant. 

The anomalistic year is the time taken for the Earth to complete one revolution with respect to its apsides . The orbit of the Earth is elliptical; the extreme points, called apsides, are the perihelion , where the Earth is closest to the Sun, and the aphelion , where the Earth is farthest from the Sun. The anomalistic year is usually defined as the time between perihelion passages. Its average duration is 365.259636 days (365 d 6 h 13 min 52.6 s) (at the epoch J2011.0). [ 15 ] 

# Draconic year 

Further information: Draconic period 

The draconic year, draconitic year, eclipse year, or ecliptic year is the time taken for the Sun (as seen from the Earth) to complete one revolution with respect to the same lunar node (a point where the Moon's orbit intersects the ecliptic). The year is associated with eclipses : these occur only when both the Sun and the Moon are near these nodes; so eclipses occur within about a month of every half eclipse year. Hence there are two eclipse seasons every eclipse year. The average duration of the eclipse year is 
346.620 075 883 days (346 d 14 h 52 min 54 s) (at the epoch J2000.0). 

This term is sometimes erroneously used for the draconic or nodal period of lunar precession , that is the period of a complete revolution of the Moon's ascending node around the ecliptic: 18.612 815 932 Julian years ( 6 798 .331 019 days; at the epoch J2000.0). 

# Full moon cycle 

The full moon cycle is the time for the Sun (as seen from the Earth) to complete one revolution with respect to the perigee of the Moon's orbit. This period is associated with the apparent size of the full moon , and also with the varying duration of the synodic month . The duration of one full moon cycle is: 
411.784 430 29 days (411 days 18 hours 49 minutes 35 seconds) (at the epoch J2000.0). 

# Lunar year 

The lunar year comprises twelve full cycles of the phases of the Moon, as seen from Earth. It has a duration of approximately 354.37 days. Muslims use this for religious purposes, including calculating the date of the Hajj and the fasting month of Ramadan , and thus also the Eids . The Jewish calendar is also mainly lunar, but with the addition of an intercalary lunar month once every two or three years, designed to keep the calendar broadly synchronous with the solar cycle. Thus, a lunar year on the Jewish (Hebrew) calendar consists of either twelve or thirteen lunar months. 

# Vague year 

The vague year, from annus vagus or wandering year, is an integral approximation to the year equaling 365 days, which wanders in relation to more exact years. Typically the vague year is divided into 12 schematic months of 30 days each plus 5 epagomenal days. The vague year was used in the calendars of Ethiopia , Ancient Egypt , Iran , Armenia and in Mesoamerica among the Aztecs and Maya . [ 16 ] It is still used by many Zoroastrian communities. 

# Heliacal year 

A heliacal year is the interval between the heliacal risings of a star. It differs from the sidereal year for stars away from the ecliptic due mainly to the precession of the equinoxes . 

# Sothic year 

The Sothic year is the heliacal year, the interval between heliacal risings, of the star Sirius . It is currently less than the sidereal year and its duration is very close to the Julian year of 365.25 days. 

# Gaussian year 

The Gaussian year is the sidereal year for a planet of negligible mass (relative to the Sun) and unperturbed by other planets that is governed by the Gaussian gravitational constant . Such a planet would be slightly closer to the Sun than Earth's mean distance. Its length is: 
365.256 8983 days (365 d 6 h 9 min 56 s). 

# Besselian year 

The Besselian year is a tropical year that starts when the (fictitious) mean Sun reaches an ecliptic longitude of 280°. This is currently on or close to January 1. It is named after the 19th-century German astronomer and mathematician Friedrich Bessel . The following equation can be used to compute the current Besselian epoch (in years): [ 17 ] 
B = 1900.0 + (Julian date TT − 2 415 020 .313 52 ) / 365.242 198 781 

The TT subscript indicates that for this formula, the Julian date should use the Terrestrial Time scale, or its predecessor, ephemeris time .

The exact length of an astronomical year changes over time. 

- The positions of the equinox and solstice points with respect to the apsides of Earth's orbit change: the equinoxes and solstices move westward relative to the stars because of precession , and the apsides move in the other direction because of the long-term effects of gravitational pull by the other planets. Since the speed of the Earth varies according to its position in its orbit as measured from its perihelion, Earth's speed when in a solstice or equinox point changes over time: if such a point moves toward perihelion, the interval between two passages decreases a little from year to year; if the point moves towards aphelion, that period increases a little from year to year. So a "tropical year" measured from one passage of the northward ("vernal") equinox to the next, differs from the one measured between passages of the southward ("autumnal") equinox. The average over the full orbit does not change because of this, so the length of the average tropical year does not change because of this second-order effect. 
- Each planet's movement is perturbed by the gravity of every other planet. This leads to short-term fluctuations in its speed, and therefore its period from year to year. Moreover, it causes long-term changes in its orbit, and therefore also long-term changes in these periods. 
- Tidal drag between the Earth and the Moon and Sun increases the length of the day and of the month (by transferring angular momentum from the rotation of the Earth to the revolution of the Moon); since the apparent mean solar day is the unit with which we measure the length of the year in civil life, the length of the year appears to decrease. The rotation rate of the Earth is also changed by factors such as post-glacial rebound and sea level rise . 

Numerical value of year variation Mean year lengths in this section are calculated for 2000, and differences in year lengths, compared to 2000, are given for past and future years. In the tables a day is 86 400 SI seconds long. [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] 
Mean year lengths for 2000 Type of year Days Hours Minutes Seconds Tropical 365 5 48 45 Sidereal 365 6 9 10 Anomalistic 365 6 13 53 Eclipse 346 14 52 55 Year length difference from 2000 (seconds; positive when length for tabulated year is greater than length in 2000) Year Tropical Sidereal Anomalistic Eclipse −4000 −8 −45 −15 −174 −2000 4 −19 −11 −116 0 7 −4 −5 −57 2000 0 0 0 0 4000 −14 −3 5 54 6000 −35 −12 10 104 

# Summary 

Some of the year lengths in this table are in average solar days , which are slowly getting longer (at a rate that cannot be exactly predicted in advance) and are now around 86 400 .002 SI seconds . 
Days Year type 346.62 Draconic, also called eclipse 354.37 Lunar 365 Solar days: vague, and a common year in many solar calendars 365.242 19 Tropical, also called solar, averaged and then rounded for epoch J2000.0 365.2425 Gregorian, solar days averaged over the 400-year cycle 365.25 Julian, solar days averaged over the four-year cycle 365.256 36 Sidereal, for epoch J2000.0 365.259 636 Anomalistic, averaged and then rounded for epoch J2011.0 366 Leap year in many solar calendars 

An average Gregorian year may be said to be 365.2425 days (52.1775 weeks , and if an hour is defined as one twenty-fourth of a day, 8 765 .82 hours , 525 949 .2 minutes or 31 556 952 seconds ). Note however that in absolute time the average Gregorian year is not adequately defined unless the period of the averaging (start and end dates) is stated, because each period of 400 years is longer (by more than 1000 seconds) than the preceding one as the rotation of the Earth slows. In this calendar, a common year is 365 days ( 8760 hours, 525 600 minutes or 31 536 000 seconds), and a leap year is 366 days ( 8784 hours, 527 040 minutes or 31 622 400 seconds). The 400-year civil cycle of the Gregorian calendar has 146 097 days and hence exactly 20 871 weeks. 

# Greater astronomical years 

# Equinoctial cycle 

The Great Year , or equinoctial cycle, corresponds to a complete revolution of the equinoxes around the ecliptic. Its length is about 25,700 years. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] 

# Galactic year 

The Galactic year is the time it takes Earth's Solar System to revolve once around the Galactic Center . It comprises roughly 230 million Earth years. [ 24 ] 

# IUPAC–IUGS proposal 

In 2011, a task group of the IUPAC and the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) jointly recommended defining the annus for geological purposes as 

1 a = 31 556 925 .445 seconds [ 25 ] (approximately 365.242 192 65 ephemeris days ) 

They chose a value close to the length of tropical year for the epoch 2000.0 (which is roughly the length of the tropical year 2000; the length of the tropical year is slowly decreasing). [ 25 ] However, the definition is as a multiple of the second, the SI base unit of time, and independent of astronomical definitions, since "[d]efinitions of the annus that are based on an intermediate relationship via the day, such as the Julian and Gregorian year, bear an inherent, pre-programmed obsolescence because of the variability of Earth's orbital movement". [ 25 ] It differs from the Julian year of 365.25 days (3.1557600 × 10 7 s) by about 21 parts per million . 

As of April 2025, the IUPAC Green Book (4th edition) provides a definition of the year as a = 31 556 925 .9747 seconds. [ 26 ] 

# Seasonal year 

Main article: Seasonal year 

Further information: Effect of Sun angle on climate 

A seasonal year is the time between successive recurrences of a seasonal event such as the flooding of a river, the migration of a species of bird, the flowering of a species of plant, the first frost, or the first scheduled game of a certain sport. All of these events can have wide variations of more than a month from year to year. 

# Symbols and abbreviations 

A common symbol for the year as a unit of time is "a", taken from the Latin word annus .
For example, the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI) supports the symbol "a" as the unit of time for a year. [ 27 ] 

In English, the abbreviations "y" or "yr" are more commonly used in non-scientific literature. [ 28 ] In some Earth sciences branches ( geology and paleontology ), " kyr , myr , byr " (thousands, millions, and billions of years, respectively) and similar abbreviations are used to denote intervals of time remote from the present. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] In astronomy the abbreviations kyr, Myr and Gyr are in common use for kiloyears, megayears and gigayears. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] 

The Unified Code for Units of Measure (UCUM) disambiguates the varying symbologies of ISO 1000, ISO 2955 and ANSI X3.50 by using: [ 10 ] 
a t = 365.242 19 days for the mean tropical year; a j = 365.25 days for the mean Julian year; a g = 365.2425 days for the mean Gregorian year ; 

In the UCUM, the symbol "a", without any qualifier, equals 1 a j .
The UCUM also minimizes confusion with are , a unit of area, by using the abbreviation "ar". 

Since 1989, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) recognizes the symbol "a" rather than "yr" for a year, notes the different kinds of year, and recommends adopting the Julian year of 365.25 days, unless otherwise specified (IAU Style Manual ). [ 33 ] [ 34 ] 

Since 1987, the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) notes "a" as the general symbol for the time unit year ( IUPAP Red Book ). [ 35 ] Since 1993, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) Green Book also uses the same symbol "a", notes the difference between Gregorian year and Julian year, and adopts the former (a = 365.2425 days), [ 36 ] also noted in the IUPAC Gold Book . [ 37 ] 

In 2011, a task group of IUPAC and IUGS recommended the use of a as the symbol for the annus (along with multiples such as Ma) for both time intervals and absolute ages. [ 25 ] This proved controversial as it conflicts with an earlier convention among geoscientists to use "a" specifically for absolute age before the present (e.g. 1 Ma for 1 million years ago), and "y" or "yr" (and My, Myr etc) for a time interval or period of time. [ 38 ] [ 39 ] 

# SI prefix multipliers 

See also: Orders of magnitude (time) 

For the following, there are alternative forms that elide the consecutive vowels, such as kilannus , megannus , etc. The exponents and exponential notations are typically used for calculating and in displaying calculations, and for conserving space, as in tables of data. 
Units of time with SI prefixes Symbol Definition Common scientific uses and notes ka (for kiloannus ) One thousand or 10 3 years, also known as a millennium in anthropology and calendar uses. Geology, paleontology, and archaeology for the Holocene and Pleistocene periods , where a non− radiocarbon dating technique such as ice core dating, dendrochronology , uranium-thorium dating or varve analysis is used as the primary method for age determination. If age is determined primarily by radiocarbon dating, then the age should be expressed in either radiocarbon or calendar (calibrated) years Before Present . Ma (for megaannus ) One million or 10 6 years. Geology, paleontology, and celestial mechanics . In astronomical applications, the year used is the Julian year of precisely 365.25 days. In geology and paleontology, the year is not so precise and varies depending on the author. Ga (for gigaannus ) One billion or 10 9 years. Cosmology and geology. [ 40 ] For example, the formation of the Earth occurred approximately 4.54 Ga (4.54 billion years) ago and the age of the universe is approximately 13.8 Ga. Ta (for teraannus ) One trillion or 10 12 years. An extremely long unit of time, about 70 times as long as the age of the universe. It is the same order of magnitude as the expected life span of a small red dwarf . Pa (for petaannus ) One quadrillion or 10 15 years. The half-life of the nuclide cadmium-113 is about 8 Pa. [ 41 ] This symbol coincides with that for the pascal without a multiplier prefix, but context will normally be sufficient to distinguish long time periods from pressure values. Ea (for exaannus ) One quintillion or 10 18 years. The half-life of tungsten-180 is 1.8 Ea. [ 42 ] 

# Abbreviations for "years ago" 

Further information: Before Present 

In geology and paleontology, a distinction sometimes is made between abbreviation "yr" for years and "ya" for years ago , combined with prefixes for thousand, million, or billion. [ 29 ] [ 43 ] In archaeology, dealing with more recent periods, normally expressed dates, e.g. "10,000 BC", may be used as a more traditional form than Before Present ("BP"). 

These abbreviations include: 
Non-SI abbreviations Short for SI-prefixed equivalent Definition Examples Event Time

bya Gya 
billion years ago giga years ago Time ago in Ga 
- Oldest Eukaryotes 
- Formation of the Earth 
- Big Bang 2 bya 4.5 bya 13.8 bya 

Use of "mya" and "bya" is deprecated in modern geophysics, the recommended usage being "Ma" and "Ga" for dates Before Present , but "m.y." for the durations of epochs. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] This ad hoc distinction between "absolute" time and time intervals is somewhat controversial amongst members of the Geological Society of America. [ 45 ]

(c) Convention and abbreviations. – The age of a stratigraphic unit or the time of a geologic event, as commonly determined by numerical dating or by reference to a calibrated time-scale, may be expressed in years before the present. The unit of time is the modern year as presently recognized worldwide.  Recommended (but not mandatory) abbreviations for such ages are SI (International System of Units) multipliers coupled with "a" for annus: ka, Ma, and Ga for kilo-annus (10 3 years), Mega-annus (10 6 years), and Giga-annus (10 9 years), respectively. Use of these terms after the age value follows the convention established in the field of C-14 dating. The "present" refers to AD 1950, and such qualifiers as "ago" or "before the present" are omitted after the value because measurement of the duration from the present to the past is implicit in the designation. In contrast, the duration of a remote interval of geologic time, as a number of years, should not be expressed by the same symbols. Abbreviations for numbers of years, without reference to the present, are informal (e.g., y or yr for years; my, m.y., or m.yr. for millions of years; and so forth, as preference dictates). For example, boundaries of the Late Cretaceous Epoch currently are calibrated at 63 Ma and 96 Ma, but the interval of time represented by this epoch is 33 m.y.

The Precambrian ( / p r i ˈ k æ m b r i . ə n , - ˈ k eɪ m -/ pree- KAM -bree-ən, -⁠KAYM- ; [ 4 ] or pre-Cambrian , sometimes abbreviated pC , or Cryptozoic ) is the earliest part of Earth's history , set before the current Phanerozoic Eon. The Precambrian is so named because it preceded the Cambrian , the first period of the Phanerozoic Eon , which is named after Cambria , the Latinized name for Wales , where rocks from this age were first studied. The Precambrian accounts for 88% of the Earth's geologic time. 

The Precambrian is an informal unit of geologic time, [ 5 ] subdivided into three eons ( Hadean , Archean , Proterozoic ) of the geologic time scale . It spans from the formation of Earth about 4.6 billion years ago ( Ga ) to the beginning of the Cambrian Period, about 538.8 million years ago ( Ma ), when hard-shelled creatures first appeared in abundance. 

# Overview 
[ edit ] 

Relatively little is known about the Precambrian, despite it making up roughly seven-eighths of the Earth's history , and what is known has largely been discovered from the 1960s onwards. The Precambrian fossil record is poorer than that of the succeeding Phanerozoic , and fossils from the Precambrian (e.g. stromatolites ) are of limited biostratigraphic use. [ 6 ] This is because many Precambrian rocks have been heavily metamorphosed , obscuring their origins, while others have been destroyed by erosion, or remain deeply buried beneath Phanerozoic strata. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] 

It is thought that the Earth coalesced from material in orbit around the Sun at roughly 4,543 Ma, and may have been struck by another planet called Theia shortly after it formed, splitting off material that formed the Moon (see Giant-impact hypothesis ). A stable crust was apparently in place by 4,433 Ma, since zircon crystals from Western Australia have been dated at 4,404 ± 8 Ma. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] 

The term "Precambrian" is used by geologists and paleontologists for general discussions not requiring a more specific eon name. However, both the United States Geological Survey [ 11 ] and the International Commission on Stratigraphy regard the term as informal. [ 12 ] Because the span of time falling under the Precambrian consists of three eons (the Hadean , the Archean , and the Proterozoic ), it is sometimes described as a supereon , [ 13 ] [ 14 ] but this is also an informal term, not defined by the ICS in its chronostratigraphic guide. [ 15 ] 

Eozoic (from eo- "earliest") was a synonym for pre-Cambrian or Precambrian , [ 16 ] [ 17 ] or more specifically Archean . [ 18 ] 

# Life forms 
[ edit ] 

Further information: Origin of life , Avalon explosion , and Earliest known life forms 

A specific date for the origin of life has not been determined. Carbon found in 3.8 billion-year-old rocks (Archean Eon) from islands off western Greenland may be of organic origin. Well-preserved microscopic fossils of bacteria older than 3.46 billion years have been found in Western Australia . [ 19 ] Probable fossils 100 million years older have been found in the same area. However, there is evidence that life could have evolved over 4.280 billion years ago. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] There is a fairly solid record of bacterial life throughout the remainder (Proterozoic Eon) of the Precambrian. 

Complex multicellular organisms may have appeared as early as 2100 Ma. [ 24 ] However, the interpretation of ancient fossils is problematic, and "... some definitions of multicellularity encompass everything from simple bacterial colonies to badgers." [ 25 ] Other possible early complex multicellular organisms include a possible 2450 Ma red alga from the Kola Peninsula , [ 26 ] 1650 Ma carbonaceous biosignatures in north China, [ 27 ] the 1600 Ma Rafatazmia , [ 28 ] and a possible 1047 Ma Bangiomorpha red alga from the Canadian Arctic. [ 29 ] The earliest fossils widely accepted as complex multicellular organisms date from the Ediacaran Period. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] A very diverse collection of soft-bodied forms is found in a variety of locations worldwide and date to between 635 and 542 Ma. These are referred to as Ediacaran or Vendian biota . Hard-shelled creatures appeared toward the end of that time span, marking the beginning of the Phanerozoic Eon. By the middle of the following Cambrian Period, a very diverse fauna is recorded in the Burgess Shale , including some which may represent stem groups of modern taxa. The increase in diversity of lifeforms during the early Cambrian is called the Cambrian explosion of life. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] 

While land seems to have been devoid of plants and animals, cyanobacteria and other microbes formed prokaryotic mats that covered terrestrial areas. [ 34 ] 

Tracks from an animal with leg-like appendages have been found in what was mud 551 million years ago. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] 

# Emergence of life 
[ edit ] 

The RNA world hypothesis asserts that RNA evolved before coded proteins and DNA genomes. [ 37 ] During the Hadean Eon (4,567–4,031 Ma) abundant geothermal microenvironments were present that may have had the potential to support the synthesis and replication of RNA and thus possibly the evolution of a primitive life form. It was shown that porous rock systems comprising heated air-water interfaces could allow ribozyme - catalyzed RNA replication of sense and antisense strands that could be followed by strand-dissociation, thus enabling combined synthesis, release and folding of active ribozymes. [ 38 ] This primitive RNA replicative system also may have been able to undergo template strand switching during replication ( genetic recombination ) as is known to occur during the RNA replication of extant coronaviruses . [ 39 ] 

# Planetary environment and the oxygen catastrophe 
[ edit ]

Evidence of the details of plate motions and other tectonic activity in the Precambrian is difficult to interpret. It is generally believed that small proto-continents existed before 4280 Ma, and that most of the Earth's landmasses collected into a single supercontinent around 1130 Ma. The supercontinent, known as Rodinia , broke up around 750 Ma. A number of glacial periods have been identified going as far back as the Huronian epoch, roughly 2400–2100 Ma. One of the best studied is the Sturtian-Varangian glaciation, around 850–635 Ma, which may have brought glacial conditions all the way to the equator, resulting in a " Snowball Earth ". [ 40 ] [ 41 ] 

It is believed that molecular oxygen was not a significant fraction of Earth's atmosphere until after photosynthetic life forms evolved and began to produce it in large quantities as a byproduct of their metabolism . This radical shift from a chemically inert to an oxidizing atmosphere caused an ecological crisis , sometimes called the oxygen catastrophe . At first, oxygen would have quickly combined with other elements in Earth's crust, primarily iron, removing it from the atmosphere. After the supply of oxidizable surfaces ran out, oxygen would have begun to accumulate in the atmosphere, and the modern high-oxygen atmosphere would have developed. Evidence for this lies in older rocks that contain massive banded iron formations that were laid down as iron oxides. [ 42 ] [ 43 ]

A terminology has evolved covering the early years of the Earth's existence, as radiometric dating has allowed absolute dates to be assigned to specific formations and features. [ 44 ] The Precambrian is divided into three eons: the Hadean (4567.3–4031 Ma), Archean (4031-2500 Ma) and Proterozoic (2500-538.8 Ma). See Timetable of the Precambrian . 

- Proterozoic : this eon refers to the time from the lower Cambrian boundary, 538.8 Ma, back through 2500 Ma. As originally used, it was a synonym for "Precambrian" and hence included everything prior to the Cambrian boundary. [ 45 ] The Proterozoic Eon is divided into three eras: the Neoproterozoic , Mesoproterozoic and Paleoproterozoic . 
- Neoproterozoic : The youngest geologic era of the Proterozoic Eon, from the Cambrian Period lower boundary (538.8 Ma) back to 1000 Ma. The Neoproterozoic corresponds to Precambrian Z rocks of older North American stratigraphy. 
- Ediacaran : The youngest geologic period within the Neoproterozoic Era. The "2012 Geologic Time Scale" dates it from 538.8 to 635 Ma. In this period the Ediacaran biota appeared. 
- Cryogenian : The middle period in the Neoproterozoic Era: 635-720 Ma. 
- Tonian : the earliest period of the Neoproterozoic Era: 720-1000 Ma. 
- Mesoproterozoic : the middle era of the Proterozoic Eon, 1000-1600 Ma. Corresponds to "Precambrian Y" rocks of older North American stratigraphy. 
- Paleoproterozoic : oldest era of the Proterozoic Eon, 1600-2500 Ma. Corresponds to "Precambrian X" rocks of older North American stratigraphy. 
- Archean Eon: 2500-4031 Ma. 
- Hadean Eon: 4031–4567.3 Ma. This term was intended originally to cover the time before any preserved rocks were deposited, although some zircon crystals from about 4400 Ma demonstrate the existence of crust in the Hadean Eon. Other records from Hadean time come from the Moon and meteorites . [ 46 ] [ 47 ] 

It has been proposed that the Precambrian should be divided into eons and eras that reflect stages of planetary evolution, rather than the current scheme based upon numerical ages. Such a system could rely on events in the stratigraphic record and be demarcated by GSSPs . The Precambrian could be divided into five "natural" eons, characterized as follows: [ 48 ] 

- Accretion and differentiation: a period of planetary formation until giant Moon-forming impact event . 
- Hadean: dominated by heavy bombardment from about 4.51 Ga (possibly including a cool early Earth period) to the end of the Late Heavy Bombardment period. 
- Archean: a period defined by the first crustal formations (the Isua greenstone belt ) until the deposition of banded iron formations due to increasing atmospheric oxygen content. 
- Transition: a period of continued banded iron formation until the first continental red beds . 
- Proterozoic: a period of modern plate tectonics until the first animals . 

# Precambrian supercontinents 
[ edit ] 

The movement of Earth's plates has caused the formation and break-up of continents over time, including occasional formation of a supercontinent containing most or all of the landmass. The earliest known supercontinent was Vaalbara . It formed from proto-continents and was a supercontinent 3.636 billion years ago. Vaalbara broke up c. 2.845–2.803 Ga ago. The supercontinent Kenorland was formed c. 2.72 Ga ago and then broke sometime after 2.45–2.1 Ga into the proto-continent cratons called Laurentia , Baltica , Yilgarn craton and Kalahari . The supercontinent Columbia , or Nuna, formed 2.1–1.8 billion years ago and broke up about 1.3–1.2 billion years ago. [ 49 ] [ 50 ] The supercontinent Rodinia is thought to have formed about 1300-900 Ma, to have included most or all of Earth's continents and to have broken up into eight continents around 750–600 million years ago. [ 51 ]

The Cambrian ( / ˈ k æ m b r i . ə n , ˈ k eɪ m -/ KAM -bree-ən, KAYM - ) is the first geological period of the Paleozoic Era, and the Phanerozoic Eon . [ 5 ] The Cambrian lasted 51.95 million years from the end of the preceding Ediacaran period 538.8 Ma (million years ago) to the beginning of the Ordovician Period 486.85 Ma. [ 1 ] 

Most of the continents were located in the southern hemisphere surrounded by the vast Panthalassa Ocean . [ 6 ] The assembly of Gondwana during the Ediacaran and early Cambrian led to the development of new convergent plate boundaries and continental-margin arc magmatism along its margins that helped drive up global temperatures. [ 7 ] Laurentia lay across the equator, separated from Gondwana by the opening Iapetus Ocean . [ 6 ] 

The Cambrian marked a profound change in life on Earth ; prior to the period, the majority of living organisms were small, unicellular and poorly preserved. Complex, multicellular organisms gradually became more common during the Ediacaran, but it was not until the Cambrian that fossil diversity seems to have rapidly increased, an event known as the Cambrian explosion , producing the first representatives of most modern animal phyla . [ 8 ] The period is also unique in its unusually high proportion of lagerstätte deposits, sites of exceptional preservation where "soft" parts of organisms are preserved as well as their more resistant shells. [ 9 ] 

# Etymology and history 
[ edit ] 

The term Cambrian is derived from the Latin version of Cymru , the Welsh name for Wales , where rocks of this age were first studied. [ 10 ] Cambria was the name given to the ancient Roman province of the country now known as Wales. [ 11 ] The geological term was named by Adam Sedgwick based on work done in the summer of 1831 in North Wales . [ 11 ] Sedgwick divided it into three groups: the Lower, Middle, and Upper Cambrian. [ 10 ] He defined the boundary between the Cambrian and the overlying Silurian , together with Roderick Murchison , in their joint paper " On the Silurian and Cambrian Systems, Exhibiting the Order in which the Older Sedimentary Strata Succeed each other in England and Wales " [ 12 ] (1836). The proposal to label the period Cambrian was based on a segment of rock strata that represented a period  of geological time. [ 11 ] 

This early agreement did not last. [ 12 ] Due to the scarcity of fossils, Sedgwick used rock types to identify Cambrian strata. He was also slow in publishing further work. The clear fossil record of the Silurian, however, allowed Murchison to correlate rocks of a similar age across Europe and Russia, and on these he published extensively. As increasing numbers of fossils were identified in older rocks, he extended the base of the Silurian downwards into the Sedgwick's "Upper Cambrian", claiming all fossilised strata for "his" Silurian series. Matters were complicated further when, in 1852, fieldwork carried out by Sedgwick and others revealed an unconformity within the Silurian, with a clear difference in fauna between the two. [ 13 ] [ 12 ] This allowed Sedgwick to now claim a large section of the Silurian for "his" Cambrian and gave the Cambrian an identifiable fossil record. The dispute between the two geologists and their supporters, over the boundary between the Cambrian and Silurian, would extend beyond the life times of both Sedgwick and Murchison. It was not resolved until 1879, when Charles Lapworth proposed the disputed strata belong to its own system, which he named the Ordovician . [ 12 ] 

The term Cambrian for the oldest period of the Paleozoic was officially agreed in 1960, at the 21st International Geological Congress . It only includes Sedgwick's "Lower Cambrian series", but its base has been extended into much older rocks. [ 10 ] 

# Geology 
[ edit ] 

# Stratigraphy 
[ edit ] 

Systems , series and stages can be defined globally or regionally. For global stratigraphic correlation, the ICS ratify rock units based on a Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) from a single formation (a stratotype ) identifying the lower boundary of the unit. Currently the boundaries of the Cambrian System, three series and six stages are defined by global stratotype sections and points. [ 1 ] 

# Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary 
[ edit ] 

The lower boundary of the Cambrian was originally held to represent the first appearance of complex life, represented by trilobites . The recognition of small shelly fossils before the first trilobites, and Ediacara biota substantially earlier, has led to calls for a more precisely defined base to the Cambrian Period. [ 14 ] 

Despite the long recognition of its distinction from younger Ordovician rocks and older Precambrian rocks, it was not until 1994 that the Cambrian system/period was internationally ratified. After decades of careful consideration, a continuous sedimentary sequence at Fortune Head , Newfoundland , Canada, was settled upon as a formal base of the Cambrian Period, which was to be correlated worldwide by the earliest appearance of Treptichnus pedum . [ 14 ] Discovery of this fossil a few metres below the GSSP led to the refinement of this statement, and it is the T. pedum ichnofossil assemblage that is now formally used to correlate the base of the Cambrian. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] 

This formal designation allowed radiometric dates to be obtained from samples across the globe that corresponded to the base of the Cambrian. An early date of 570 Ma quickly gained favour, [ 14 ] though the methods used to obtain this number are now considered to be unsuitable and inaccurate. A more precise analysis using modern radiometric dating yields a date of 538.8 ± 0.6 Ma. [ 1 ] The ash horizon in Oman from which this date was recovered corresponds to a marked fall in the abundance of carbon-13 that correlates to equivalent excursions elsewhere in the world, and to the disappearance of distinctive Ediacaran fossils ( Namacalathus , Cloudina ). Nevertheless, there are arguments that the dated horizon in Oman does not correspond to the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary, but represents a facies change from marine to evaporite-dominated strata – which would mean that dates from other sections, ranging from 544 to 542 Ma, are more suitable. [ 14 ]

# Terreneuvian 
[ edit ] 

The Terreneuvian is the lowermost series/ epoch of the Cambrian, lasting from 538.8 ± 0.6 Ma to c. 521 Ma. It is divided into two stages: the Fortunian stage, 538.8 ± 0.6 Ma to c. 529 Ma; and the unnamed Stage 2, c. 529 Ma to c. 521 Ma. [ 1 ] The name Terreneuvian was ratified by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) in 2007, replacing the previous "Cambrian Series 1". The GSSP defining its base is at Fortune Head on the Burin Peninsula, eastern Newfoundland, Canada (see Ediacaran - Cambrian boundary above). The Terreneuvian is the only series in the Cambrian to contain no trilobite fossils. Its lower part is characterised by complex, sediment-penetrating Phanerozoic-type trace fossils , and its upper part by small shelly fossils. [ 10 ] 

# Cambrian Series 2 
[ edit ] 

The second series/epoch of the Cambrian is currently unnamed and known as Cambrian Series 2 . It lasted from c. 521 Ma to c. 506.5 Ma. Its two stages are also unnamed and known as Cambrian Stage 3 , c. 521 Ma to c. 514.5 Ma, and Cambrian Stage 4 , c. 514.5 Ma to c. 506.5 Ma. [ 1 ] The base of Series 2 does not yet have a GSSP, but it is expected to be defined in strata marking the first appearance of trilobites in Gondwana . There was a rapid diversification of metazoans during this epoch, but their restricted geographic distribution, particularly of the trilobites and archaeocyaths , have made global correlations difficult, hence ongoing efforts to establish a GSSP. [ 10 ] Much work has been done in South Australia in identifying archaeocyaths and trilobites by academics, geologists, students, and others since the late 19th century. These include Ralph Tate (1840-1901), R.L. Etheridge  Junior (1846-1920), Walter Howchin (1845-1937), Edgeworth David (1858-1934), Robert Bedford (1874-1951), Thomas Griffith Taylor (1880-1963), Douglas Mawson (1882–1958), Cecil Madigan (1889-1947), and R. C. Sprigg (1919-1994). [ 16 ] 

# Miaolingian 
[ edit ] 
Diorama of the Burgess Shale Biota 

The Miaolingian is the third series/epoch of the Cambrian, lasting from c. 506.5 Ma to c. 497 Ma, and roughly identical to the middle Cambrian in older literature. [ 17 ] It is divided into three stages: the Wuliuan c. 506.5 Ma to 504.5 Ma; the Drumian c. 504.5 Ma to c. 500.5 Ma; and the Guzhangian c. 500.5 Ma to c. 497 Ma. [ 1 ] The name replaces Cambrian Series 3 and was ratified by the IUGS in 2018. [ 18 ] It is named after the Miaoling Mountains in southeastern Guizhou Province , South China, where the GSSP marking its base is found. This is defined by the first appearance of the oryctocephalid trilobite Oryctocephalus indicus . Secondary markers for the base of the Miaolingian include the appearance of many acritarchs forms, a global marine transgression , and the disappearance of the polymerid trilobites, Bathynotus or Ovatoryctocara. Unlike the Terreneuvian and Series 2, all the stages of the Miaolingian are defined by GSSPs . [ 18 ] 

The olenellids , eodiscids , and most redlichiids trilobites went extinct at the boundary between Series 2 and the Miaolingian. This is considered the oldest mass extinction of trilobites. [ 10 ] 

# Furongian 
[ edit ] 

The Furongian , c. 497 Ma to 486.85 ± 1.5 Ma, is the fourth and uppermost series/epoch of the Cambrian. The name was ratified by the IUGS in 2003 and replaces Cambrian Series 4 and the traditional "Upper Cambrian". The GSSP for the base of the Furongian is in the Wuling Mountains , in northwestern Hunan Province , China. It coincides with the first appearance of the agnostoid trilobite Glyptagnostus reticulatus , and is near the beginning of a large positive δ 13 C isotopic excursion. [ 10 ] 

The Furongian is divided into three stages: the Paibian , c. 497 Ma to c. 494 Ma, and the Jiangshanian c. 494.2 Ma to c. 491 Ma, which have defined GSSPs; and the unnamed Cambrian Stage 10 , c. 491 Ma to 486.85 ± 1.5 Ma. [ 1 ] 

# Cambrian–Ordovician boundary 
[ edit ] 

The GSSP for the Cambrian–Ordovician boundary is at Green Point , western Newfoundland , Canada, and is dated at 486.85 Ma. It is defined by the appearance of the conodont Iapetognathus fluctivagus . Where these conodonts are not found the appearance of planktonic graptolites or the trilobite Jujuyaspis borealis can be used. The boundary also corresponds with the peak of the largest positive variation in the δ 13 C curve during the boundary time interval and with a global marine transgression. [ 19 ] 

# Impact structures 
[ edit ] 

Major meteorite impact structures include: the early Cambrian (c. 535 Ma) Neugrund crater in the Gulf of Finland , Estonia, a complex meteorite crater about 20 km in diameter, with two inner ridges of about 7 km and 6 km diameter, and an outer ridge of 8 km that formed as the result of an impact of an asteroid 1 km in diameter; [ 20 ] the 5 km diameter Gardnos crater (500±10 Ma) in Buskerud , Norway, where post-impact sediments indicate the impact occurred in a shallow marine environment with rock avalanches and debris flows occurring as the crater rim was breached not long after impact; [ 21 ] the 24 km diameter Presqu'ile crater (500 Ma or younger) Quebec , Canada; the 19 km diameter Glikson crater (c. 508 Ma) in Western Australia; the 5 km diameter Mizarai crater (500±10 Ma) in Lithuania; and the 3.2 km diameter Newporte structure (c. 500 Ma or slightly younger) in North Dakota , U.S.A. [ 22 ] 

# Paleogeography 
[ edit ] 

Reconstructing the position of the continents during the Cambrian is based on palaeomagnetic , palaeobiogeographic , tectonic , geological and palaeoclimatic data. However, these have different levels of uncertainty and can produce contradictory locations for the major continents. [ 23 ] This, together with the ongoing debate around the existence of the Neoproterozoic supercontinent of Pannotia , means that while most models agree the continents lay in the southern hemisphere, with the vast Panthalassa Ocean covering most of northern hemisphere, the exact distribution and timing of the movements of the Cambrian continents varies between models. [ 23 ]

Plate boundaries: red - subduction; white - ridges; yellow - transform. [ 24 ] [ 6 ] 

Most models show Gondwana stretching from the south polar region to north of the equator. [ 6 ] Early in the Cambrian, the south pole corresponded with the western South American sector and as Gondwana rotated anti-clockwise, by the middle of the Cambrian, the south pole lay in the northwest African region. [ 23 ] 

Laurentia lay across the equator, separated from Gondwana by the Iapetus Ocean . [ 6 ] Proponents of Pannotia have Laurentia and Baltica close to the Amazonia region of Gondwana with a narrow Iapetus Ocean that only began to open once Gondwana was fully assembled c. 520 Ma. [ 25 ] Those not in favour of the existence of Pannotia show the Iapetus opening during the Late Neoproterozoic, with up to c. 6,500 km (c. 4038 miles) between Laurentia and West Gondwana at the beginning of the Cambrian. [ 6 ] 

Of the smaller continents, Baltica lay between Laurentia and Gondwana, the Ran Ocean (an arm of the Iapetus) opening between it and Gondwana. Siberia lay close to the western margin of Gondwana and to the north of Baltica. [ 26 ] [ 6 ] Annamia and South China formed a single continent situated off north central Gondwana. The location of North China is unclear. It may have lain along the northeast Indian sector of Gondwana or already have been a separate continent. [ 6 ] 

# Laurentia 
[ edit ] 

During the Cambrian, Laurentia lay across or close to the equator.  It drifted south and rotated c. 20° anticlockwise during the middle Cambrian, before drifting north again in the late Cambrian. [ 6 ] 

After the Late Neoproterozoic (or mid-Cambrian) rifting of Laurentia from Gondwana and the subsequent opening of the Iapetus Ocean, Laurentia was largely surrounded by passive margins with much of the continent covered by shallow seas. [ 6 ] 

As Laurentia separated from Gondwana, a sliver of continental terrane rifted from Laurentia with the narrow Taconic seaway opening between them. The remains of this terrane are now found in southern Scotland, Ireland, and Newfoundland. Intra-oceanic subduction either to the southeast of this terrane in the Iapetus, or to its northwest in the Taconic seaway, resulted in the formation of an island arc . This accreted to the terrane in the late Cambrian, triggering southeast-dipping subduction beneath the terrane itself and consequent closure of the marginal seaway. The terrane collided with Laurentia in the Early Ordovician. [ 27 ] 

Towards the end of the early Cambrian, rifting along Laurentia's southeastern margin led to the separation of Cuyania (now part of Argentina) from the Ouachita embayment with a new ocean established that continued to widen through the Cambrian and Early Ordovician. [ 27 ] 

# Gondwana 
[ edit ] 

Gondwana was a massive continent, three times the size of any of the other Cambrian continents. Its continental land area extended from the south pole to north of the equator. Around it were extensive shallow seas and numerous smaller land areas. [ 6 ] 

The cratons that formed Gondwana came together during the Neoproterozoic to early Cambrian. A narrow ocean separated Amazonia from Gondwana until c. 530 Ma [ 28 ] and the Arequipa-Antofalla block united with the South American sector of Gondwana in the early Cambrian. [ 6 ] The Kuunga Orogeny between northern ( Congo Craton , Madagascar and India ) and southern Gondwana ( Kalahari Craton and East Antarctica ), which began c. 570 Ma, continued with parts of northern Gondwana over-riding southern Gondwana and was accompanied by metamorphism and the intrusion of granites . [ 29 ] 

Subduction zones , active since the Neoproterozoic, extended around much of Gondwana's margins, from northwest Africa southwards round South America, South Africa , East Antarctica , and the eastern edge of West Australia. Shorter subduction zones existed north of Arabia and India. [ 6 ] 

The Famatinian continental arc stretched from central Peru in the north to central Argentina in the south. Subduction beneath this proto- Andean margin began by the late Cambrian. [ 27 ] 

Along the northern margin of Gondwana, between northern Africa and the Armorican Terranes of southern Europe, the continental arc of the Cadomian Orogeny continued from the Neoproterozoic in response to the oblique subduction of the Iapetus Ocean. [ 30 ] This subduction extended west along the Gondwanan margin and by c. 530 Ma may have evolved into a major transform fault system. [ 30 ] 

At c. 511 Ma the continental flood basalts of the Kalkarindji large igneous province (LIP) began to erupt. These covered an area of > 2.1 million km 2 across northern, central and Western Australia regions of Gondwana making it one of the largest, as well as the earliest, LIPs of the Phanerozoic. The timing of the eruptions suggests they played a role in the early to middle Cambrian mass extinction . [ 30 ] 

# Ganderia, East and West Avalonia, Carolinia and Meguma Terranes 
[ edit ] 

The terranes of Ganderia , East and West Avalonia , Carolinia and Meguma lay in polar regions during the early Cambrian, and high-to-mid southern latitudes by the mid to late Cambrian. [ 27 ] [ 23 ] They are commonly shown as an island arc-transform fault system along the northwestern margin of Gondwana north of northwest Africa and Amazonia, which rifted from Gondwana during the Ordovician. [ 27 ] However, some models show these terranes as part of a single independent microcontinent , Greater Avalonia, lying to the west of Baltica and aligned with its eastern ( Timanide ) margin, with the Iapetus to the north and the Ran Ocean to the south. [ 23 ]

Plate boundaries: red - subduction; white - ridges; yellow - transform. [ 6 ] [ 31 ] 

# Baltica 
[ edit ] 

During the Cambrian, Baltica rotated more than 60° anti-clockwise and began to drift northwards. [ 27 ] This rotation was accommodated by major strike-slip movements in the Ran Ocean between it and Gondwana. [ 6 ] 

Baltica lay at mid-to-high southerly latitudes, separated from Laurentia by the Iapetus and from Gondwana by the Ran Ocean. It was composed of two continents, Fennoscandia and Sarmatia , separated by shallow seas. [ 6 ] [ 27 ] The sediments deposited in these unconformably overlay Precambrian basement rocks. The lack of coarse-grained sediments indicates low lying topography across the centre of the craton. [ 6 ] 

Along Baltica's northeastern margin subduction and arc magmatism associated with the Ediacaran Timanian Orogeny was coming to an end. In this region the early to middle Cambrian was a time of non-deposition and followed by late Cambrian rifting and sedimentation. [ 32 ] 

Its southeastern margin was also a convergent boundary , with the accretion of island arcs and microcontinents to the craton, although the details are unclear. [ 6 ] 

# Siberia 
[ edit ] 

Siberia began the Cambrian close to western Gondwana and north of Baltica. It drifted northwestwards to close to the equator as the Ægir Ocean opened between it and Baltica. [ 6 ] [ 26 ] Much of the continent was covered by shallow seas with extensive archaeocyathan reefs . The then northern third of the continent (present day south; Siberia has rotated 180° since the Cambrian) adjacent to its convergent margin was mountainous. [ 6 ] 

From the Late Neoproterozoic to the Ordovician, a series of island arcs accreted to Siberia's then northeastern margin, accompanied by extensive arc and back-arc volcanism. These now form the Altai-Sayan terranes. [ 6 ] [ 32 ] Some models show a convergent plate margin extending from Greater Avalonia, through the Timanide margin of Baltica, forming the Kipchak island arc offshore of southeastern Siberia and curving round to become part of the Altai-Sayan convergent margin. [ 23 ] 

Along the then western margin, Late Neoproterozoic to early Cambrian rifting was followed by the development of a passive margin. [ 32 ] 

To the then north, Siberia was separated from the Central Mongolian terrane by the narrow and slowly opening Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean . The Central Mongolian terrane's northern margin with the Panthalassa was convergent, whilst its southern margin facing the Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean was passive. [ 6 ] 

# Central Asia 
[ edit ] 

During the Cambrian, the terranes that would form Kazakhstania later in the Paleozoic were a series of island arc and accretionary complexes that lay along an intra-oceanic convergent plate margin to the south of North China. [ 32 ] 

To the south of these the Tarim microcontinent lay between Gondwana and Siberia. [ 6 ] Its northern margin was passive for much of the Paleozoic, with thick sequences of platform carbonates and fluvial to marine sediments resting unconformably on Precambrian basement. Along its southeast margin was the Altyn Cambro–Ordovician accretionary complex, whilst to the southwest a subduction zone was closing the narrow seaway between the North West Kunlun region of Tarim and the South West Kunlun terrane. [ 32 ] 

# North China 
[ edit ] 
Life reconstruction of the Linyi Lagerstätte in Northern China 

North China lay at equatorial to tropical latitudes during the early Cambrian, although its exact position is unknown. [ 26 ] Some models show that it lies below the equatorial latitudes. [ 33 ] Much of the craton was covered by shallow seas, with land in the northwest and southeast. [ 6 ] 

Northern North China was a passive margin until the onset of subduction and the development of the Bainaimiao arc in the late Cambrian. To its south was a convergent margin with a southwest dipping subduction zone, beyond which lay the North Qinling terrane (now part of the Qinling Orogenic Belt ), together with Qilian-Qaidam, Altyn belts, and South West Kunlun terranes. [ 32 ] 

# South China and Annamia 
[ edit ] 
Haikouichthys is an extinct fish -like craniate that lived in what is now China approximately 518 million ago 

South China and Annamia formed a single continent. Strike-slip movement between it and Gondwana accommodated its steady drift northwards from offshore the Indian sector of Gondwana to near the western Australian sector. This northward drift is evidenced by the progressive increase in limestones and increasing faunal diversity. [ 6 ] 

The northern margin South China, including the South Qinling block, was a passive margin. [ 6 ] 

Along the southeastern margin, lower Cambrian volcanics indicate the accretion of an island arc along the Song Ma suture zone. Also, early in the Cambrian, the eastern margin of South China changed from passive to active, with the development of oceanic volcanic island arcs that now form part of the Japanese terrane . [ 6 ] 

# Climate 
[ edit ] 

The distribution of climate-indicating sediments, including the wide latitudinal distribution of tropical carbonate platforms, archaeocyathan reefs and bauxites , and arid zone evaporites and calcrete deposits, show the Cambrian was a time of greenhouse climate conditions. [ 6 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] During the late Cambrian the distribution of trilobite provinces also indicate only a moderate pole-to-equator temperature gradient. [ 35 ] There is evidence of glaciation at high latitudes on Avalonia. However, it is unclear whether these sediments are early Cambrian or actually late Neoproterozoic in age. [ 34 ] 

Calculations of global average temperatures (GAT) vary depending on which techniques are used. Whilst some measurements show GAT over c. 40 °C (104 °F) models that combine multiple sources give GAT of c. 20–22 °C (68–72 °F) in the Terreneuvian increasing to c. 23–25 °C (73–77 °F) for the rest of the Cambrian. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] The warm climate was linked to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Assembly of Gondwana led to the reorganisation of the tectonic plates with the development of new convergent plate margins and continental-margin arc magmatism that helped drive climatic warming. [ 36 ] [ 7 ] The eruptions of the Kalkarindji LIP basalts during Stage 4 and into the early Miaolingian, also released large quantities of carbon dioxide, methane and sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere leading to rapid climatic changes and elevated sea surface temperatures. [ 7 ] 

There is uncertainty around the maximum sea surface temperatures. These are calculated using δ 18 O values from marine rocks, and there is an ongoing debate about the levels δ 18 O in Cambrian seawater relative to the rest of the Phanerozoic. [ 35 ] [ 37 ] Estimates for tropical sea surface temperatures vary from c. 28–32 °C (82–90 °F), [ 35 ] [ 37 ] to c. 29–38 °C (84–100 °F). [ 38 ] [ 34 ] Modern average tropical sea surface temperatures are 26 °C (79 °F). [ 35 ] 

Atmospheric oxygen levels rose steadily rising from the Neoproterozoic due to the increase in photosynthesising organisms. Cambrian levels varied between c. 3% and 14% (present day levels are c. 21%). Low levels of atmospheric oxygen and the warm climate resulted in lower dissolved oxygen concentrations in marine waters and widespread anoxia in deep ocean waters. [ 36 ] [ 39 ] 

There is a complex relationship between oxygen levels, the biogeochemistry of ocean waters, and the evolution of life. Newly evolved burrowing organisms exposed anoxic sediments to the overlying oxygenated seawater. This bioturbation decreased the burial rates of organic carbon and sulphur , which over time reduced atmospheric and oceanic oxygen levels, leading to widespread anoxic conditions. [ 40 ] Periods of higher rates of continental weathering led to increased delivery of nutrients to the oceans, boosting productivity of phytoplankton and stimulating metazoan evolution. However, rapid increases in nutrient supply led to eutrophication , where rapid growth in phytoplankton numbers result in the depletion of oxygen in the surrounding waters. [ 36 ] [ 41 ] 

Pulses of increased oxygen levels are linked to increased biodiversity; raised oxygen levels supported the increasing metabolic demands of organisms, and increased ecological niches by expanding habitable areas of seafloor. Conversely, incursions of oxygen-deficient water, due to changes in sea level, ocean circulation, upwellings from deeper waters and/or biological productivity, produced anoxic conditions that limited habitable areas, reduced ecological niches and resulted in extinction events both regional and global. [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] 

Overall, these dynamic, fluctuating environments, with global and regional anoxic incursions resulting in extinction events, and periods of increased oceanic oxygenation stimulating biodiversity, drove evolutionary innovation. [ 40 ] [ 36 ] [ 41 ] 

# Geochemistry 
[ edit ] 

During the Cambrian, variations in isotope ratios were more frequent and more pronounced than later in the Phanerozoic, with at least 10 carbon isotope ( δ 13 C ) excursions (significant variations in global isotope ratios) recognised. [ 10 ] These excursions record changes in the biogeochemistry of the oceans and atmosphere, which are due to processes such as the global rates of continental arc magmatism, rates of weathering and nutrients levels entering the marine environment, sea level changes, and biological factors including the impact of burrowing fauna on oxygen levels. [ 36 ] [ 41 ] [ 7 ] 

# Isotope excursions 
[ edit ] 

# Base of Cambrian 
[ edit ] 

The basal Cambrian δ 13 C excursion (BACE), together with low δ 238 U and raised δ 34 S indicates a period of widespread shallow marine anoxia, which occurs at the same time as the extinction of the Ediacaran acritarchs. It was followed by the rapid appearance and diversification of bilaterian animals. [ 10 ] [ 36 ] 

# Cambrian Stages 2 and 3 
[ edit ] 

During the early Cambrian, 87 Sr/ 86 Sr rose in response to enhanced continental weathering. This increased the input of nutrients into the oceans and led to higher burial rates of organic matter. [ 42 ] Over long timescales, the extra oxygen released by organic carbon burial is balanced by a decrease in the rates of pyrite (FeS 2 ) burial (a process which also releases oxygen), leading to stable levels of oxygen in the atmosphere. However, during the early Cambrian, a series of linked δ 13 C and δ 34 S excursions indicate high burial rates of both organic carbon and pyrite in biologically productive yet anoxic ocean floor waters. The oxygen-rich waters produced by these processes spread from the deep ocean into shallow marine environments, extending the habitable regions of the seafloor. [ 10 ] [ 43 ] These pulses of oxygen are associated with the radiation of the small shelly fossils and the Cambrian arthropod radiation isotope excursion (CARE). [ 42 ] The increase in oxygenated waters in the deep ocean ultimately reduced the levels of organic carbon and pyrite burial, leading to a decrease in oxygen production and the re-establishment of anoxic conditions. This cycle was repeated several times during the early Cambrian. [ 10 ] [ 43 ]

# Cambrian Stage 4 to early Miaolingian 
[ edit ] 

The beginning of the eruptions of the Kalkarindji LIP basalts during Stage 4 and the early Miaolingian released large quantities of carbon dioxide, methane and sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere. The changes these wrought are reflected by three large and rapid δ 13 C excursions. Increased temperatures led to a global sea level rise that flooded continental shelves and interiors with anoxic waters from the deeper ocean and drowned carbonate platforms of archaeocyathan reefs, resulting in the widespread accumulation of black organic-rich shales. Known as the Sinsk anoxic extinction event, this triggered the first major extinction of the Phanerozoic, the 513 – 508 Ma Botoman-Toyonian Extinction (BTE), which included the loss of the archaeocyathids and hyoliths and saw a major drop in biodiversity. [ 7 ] [ 43 ] The rise in sea levels is also evidenced by a global decrease in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr. The flooding of continental areas decreased the rates of continental weathering, reducing the input of 87 Sr to the oceans and lowering the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr of seawater. [ 42 ] [ 10 ] 

The base of the Miaolingian is marked by the Redlichiid–Olenellid extinction carbon isotope event (ROECE), which coincides with the main phase of Kalkarindji volcanism. [ 7 ] 

During the Miaolingian, orogenic events along the Australian-Antarctic margin of Gondwana led to an increase in weathering and an influx of nutrients into the ocean, raising the level of productivity and organic carbon burial. These can be seen in the steady increase in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and δ 13 C. [ 42 ] 

# Early Furongian 
[ edit ] 

Continued erosion of the deeper levels of the Gondwanan mountain belts led to a peak in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and linked positive δ 13 C and δ 34 S excursions, known as the Steptoean positive carbon isotope excursion (SPICE). [ 7 ] This indicates similar geochemical conditions to Stages 2 and 3 of the early Cambrian existed, with the expansion of seafloor anoxia enhancing the burial rates of organic matter and pyrite. [ 42 ] This increase in the extent of anoxic seafloor conditions led to the extinction of the marjumiid and damesellid trilobites, whilst the increase in oxygen levels that followed helped drive the radiation of plankton. [ 10 ] [ 36 ] 

87 Sr/ 86 Sr fell sharply near the top of the Jiangshanian Stage, and through Stage 10 as the Gondwanan mountains were eroded down and rates of weathering decreased. [ 10 ] [ 42 ] 

# Magnesium/calcium isotope ratios in seawater 
[ edit ] 

The mineralogy of inorganic marine carbonates has varied through the Phanerozoic, controlled by the Mg 2+ /Ca 2+ values of seawater. High Mg 2+ /Ca 2+ result in calcium carbonate precipitation dominated by aragonite and high-magnesium calcite , known as aragonite seas , and low ratios result in calcite seas where low-magnesium calcite is the primary calcium carbonate precipitate. [ 44 ] The shells and skeletons of biomineralising organisms reflect the dominant form of calcite. [ 45 ] 

During the late Ediacaran to early Cambrian increasing oxygen levels led to a decrease in ocean acidity and an increase in the concentration of calcium in sea water. However, there was not a simple transition from aragonite to calcite seas, rather a protracted and variable change through the Cambrian. Aragonite and high-magnesium precipitation continued from the Ediacaran into Cambrian Stage 2. Low-magnesium calcite skeletal hard parts appear in Cambrian Age 2, but inorganic precipitation of aragonite also occurred at this time. [ 45 ] Mixed aragonite–calcite seas continued through the middle and late Cambrian, with fully calcite seas not established until the early Ordovician. [ 45 ] 

These variations and slow decrease in Mg 2+ /Ca 2+ of seawater were due to low oxygen levels, high continental weathering rates and the geochemistry of the Cambrian seas. In conditions of low oxygen and high iron levels, iron substitutes for magnesium in authigenic clay minerals deposited on the ocean floor, slowing the removal rates of magnesium from seawater. The enrichment of ocean waters in silica, prior to the radiation of siliceous organisms, and the limited bioturbation of the anoxic ocean floor increased the rates of deposition, relative to the rest of the Phanerozoic, of these clays. This, together with the high input of magnesium into the oceans via enhanced continental weathering, delayed the reduction in Mg 2+ /Ca 2+ and facilitated continued aragonite precipitation. [ 44 ] 

The conditions that favoured the deposition of authigenic clays were also ideal for the formation of lagerstätten , with the minerals in the clays replacing the soft body parts of Cambrian organisms. [ 36 ] 

# Flora 
[ edit ] 

The Cambrian flora was little different from the Ediacaran. The principal taxa were the marine macroalgae Fuxianospira , Sinocylindra , and Marpolia . No calcareous macroalgae are known from the period. [ 46 ] 

No land plant ( embryophyte ) fossils are known from the Cambrian. However, biofilms and microbial mats were well developed on Cambrian tidal flats and beaches 500 mya, [ 47 ] and microbes forming microbial Earth ecosystems , comparable with modern soil crust of desert regions, contributing to soil formation. [ 48 ] [ 49 ] Although molecular clock estimates suggest terrestrial plants may have first emerged during the Middle or Late Cambrian, the consequent large-scale removal of the greenhouse gas CO 2 from the atmosphere through sequestration did not begin until the Ordovician. [ 50 ] 

Land plants may have emerged during the Cambrian, but the evidence for this is fragmentary and contested and the oldest unamibiguous evidence for land plants is from the following Ordovician. [ 51 ] Molecular clock estimates have also led some authors to suggest that arthropods colonised land during the Cambrian, but again the earliest physical evidence of this is during the following Ordovician. [ 52 ]

Main article: Cambrian explosion 

The Cambrian explosion was a period of rapid multicellular growth. Most animal life during the Cambrian was aquatic. Trilobites were once assumed to be the dominant life form at that time, [ 53 ] but this has proven to be incorrect. Arthropods were by far the most dominant animals in the ocean, but trilobites were only a minor part of the total arthropod diversity. What made them so apparently abundant was their heavy armor reinforced by calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ), which fossilized far more easily than the fragile chitinous exoskeletons of other arthropods, leaving numerous preserved remains. [ 54 ] 

The period marked a steep change in the diversity and composition of Earth's biosphere . The Ediacaran biota suffered a mass extinction at the start of the Cambrian Period, which corresponded with an increase in the abundance and complexity of burrowing behaviour. This behaviour had a profound and irreversible effect on the substrate which transformed the seabed ecosystems. Before the Cambrian, the sea floor was covered by microbial mats . By the end of the Cambrian, burrowing animals had destroyed the mats in many areas through bioturbation. As a consequence, many of those organisms that were dependent on the mats became extinct, while the other species adapted to the changed environment that now offered new ecological niches. [ 55 ] Around the same time there was a seemingly rapid appearance of representatives of all the mineralized phyla , including the Bryozoa , [ 56 ] which were once thought to have only appeared in the Lower Ordovician. [ 57 ] However, many of those phyla were represented only by stem-group forms; and since mineralized phyla generally have a benthic origin, they may not be a good proxy for (more abundant) non-mineralized phyla. [ 58 ]

While the early Cambrian showed such diversification that it has been named the Cambrian Explosion, this changed later in the period, when there occurred a sharp drop in biodiversity. About 515 Ma, the number of species going extinct exceeded the number of new species appearing. Five million years later, the number of genera had dropped from an earlier peak of about 600 to just 450. Also, the speciation rate in many groups was reduced to between a fifth and a third of previous levels. 500 Ma, oxygen levels fell dramatically in the oceans, leading to hypoxia , while the level of poisonous hydrogen sulfide simultaneously increased, causing another extinction. The later half of Cambrian was surprisingly barren and showed evidence of several rapid extinction events; the stromatolites which had been replaced by reef building sponges known as Archaeocyatha , returned once more as the archaeocyathids became extinct. This declining trend did not change until the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event . [ 60 ] [ 61 ] 

Marine life lived under low and fluctuating levels of oxygen in the ocean. During upwellings of anoxic deep ocean waters into shallow marine environments could push organisms over the edge into mass extinctions, leading ultimately to increased biodiversity . [ 36 ] 
Artistic reconstruction of Marjum biota , including various arthropods ( trilobites , hymenocarines , and radiodonts ), sponges, echinoderms, and various other groups 

Some Cambrian organisms ventured onto land, producing the trace fossils Protichnites and Climactichnites . Fossil evidence suggests that euthycarcinoids , an extinct group of arthropods, produced at least some of the Protichnites . [ 62 ] Fossils of the track-maker of Climactichnites have not been found; however, fossil trackways and resting traces suggest a large, slug -like mollusc . [ 63 ] 

In contrast to later periods, the Cambrian fauna was somewhat restricted; free-floating organisms were rare, with the majority living on or close to the sea floor; [ 64 ] and mineralizing animals were rarer than in future periods, in part due to the unfavourable ocean chemistry . [ 64 ] 

Many modes of preservation are unique to the Cambrian, and some preserve soft body parts, resulting in an abundance of Lagerstätten . These include Sirius Passet , [ 65 ] [ 66 ] the Sinsk Algal Lens, [ 67 ] the Maotianshan Shales , [ 68 ] the Emu Bay Shale , [ 69 ] and the Burgess Shale. [ 70 ] [ 71 ] [ 72 ]

The Ordovician ( / ɔːr d ə ˈ v ɪ ʃ i . ə n , - d oʊ -, - ˈ v ɪ ʃ ən / or-də- VISH -ee-ən, -⁠doh-, -⁠ VISH -ən ) [ 8 ] is a geologic period and system , the second of six periods of the Paleozoic Era , and the second of twelve periods of the Phanerozoic Eon . The Ordovician spans 41.6 million years from the end of the Cambrian Period 486.85 Ma (million years ago) to the start of the Silurian Period 443.1 Ma. [ 9 ] 

The Ordovician, named after the Welsh tribe of the Ordovices , was defined by Charles Lapworth in 1879 to resolve a dispute between followers of Adam Sedgwick and Roderick Murchison , who were placing the same rock beds in North Wales in the Cambrian and Silurian systems, respectively. [ 10 ] Lapworth recognized that the fossil fauna in the disputed strata were different from those of either the Cambrian or the Silurian systems, and placed them in a system of their own. The Ordovician received international approval in 1960 (forty years after Lapworth's death), when it was adopted as an official period of the Paleozoic Era by the International Geological Congress . 

Life continued to flourish during the Ordovician as it had in the earlier Cambrian Period, although the end of the period was marked by the Ordovician–Silurian extinction events . Invertebrates, namely molluscs and arthropods , dominated the oceans, with members of the latter group probably starting their establishment on land during this time, becoming fully established by the Devonian . The first land plants are known from this period. The Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event considerably increased the diversity of life. Fish , the world's first true vertebrates , continued to evolve, and those with jaws may have first appeared late in the period. About 100 times as many meteorites struck the Earth per year during the Ordovician compared with today in a period known as the Ordovician meteor event . [ 11 ] It has been theorized that this increase in impacts may originate from a ring system that formed around Earth at the time. [ 12 ] 

# Subdivisions 
[ edit ] 

In 2008, the ICS erected a formal international system of subdivisions for the Ordovician Period and System. [ 13 ] Pre-existing Baltoscandic, British, Siberian, North American, Australian, Chinese, Mediterranean and North- Gondwanan regional stratigraphic schemes are also used locally. [ 14 ]

# Paleogeography and tectonics

During the Ordovician, the southern continents were assembled into Gondwana , which reached from north of the equator to the South Pole . The Panthalassic Ocean, centered in the northern hemisphere, covered over half the globe. [ 15 ] At the start of the period, the continents of Laurentia (in present-day North America ), Siberia , and Baltica (present-day northern Europe) were separated from Gondwana by over 5,000 kilometres (3,100 mi) of ocean. These smaller continents were also sufficiently widely separated from each other to develop distinct communities of benthic organisms. [ 16 ] The small continent of Avalonia had just rifted from Gondwana and began to move north towards Baltica and Laurentia, opening the Rheic Ocean between Gondwana and Avalonia. [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] Avalonia collided with Baltica towards the end of Ordovician. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] 

Other geographic features of the Ordovician world included the Tornquist Sea , which separated Avalonia from Baltica; [ 16 ] the Aegir Ocean, which separated Baltica from Siberia; [ 22 ] and an oceanic area between Siberia, Baltica, and Gondwana which expanded to become the Paleoasian Ocean in Carboniferous time. The Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean formed a deep embayment between Siberia and the Central Mongolian terranes . Most of the terranes of central Asia were part of an equatorial archipelago whose geometry is poorly constrained by the available evidence. [ 23 ] 

The period was one of extensive, widespread tectonism and volcanism. However, orogenesis (mountain-building) was not primarily due to continent-continent collisions. Instead, mountains arose along active continental margins during accretion of arc terranes or ribbon microcontinents. Accretion of new crust was limited to the Iapetus margin of Laurentia; elsewhere, the pattern was of rifting in back-arc basins followed by remerger. This reflected episodic switching from extension to compression. The initiation of new subduction reflected a global reorganization of tectonic plates centered on the amalgamation of Gondwana. [ 24 ] [ 16 ] 

The Taconic orogeny , a major mountain-building episode, was well under way in Cambrian times. [ 25 ] This continued into the Ordovician, when at least two volcanic island arcs collided with Laurentia to form the Appalachian Mountains . Laurentia was otherwise tectonically stable. An island arc accreted to South China during the period, while subduction along north China (Sulinheer) resulted in the emplacement of ophiolites. [ 26 ] 

The ash fall of the Millburg/Big Bentonite bed , at about 454 Ma, was the largest in the last 590 million years. This had a dense rock equivalent volume of as much as 1,140 cubic kilometres (270 cu mi). Remarkably, this appears to have had little impact on life. [ 27 ] 

There was vigorous tectonic activity along northwest margin of Gondwana during the Floian, 478 Ma, recorded in the Central Iberian Zone of Spain. The activity reached as far as Turkey by the end of Ordovician. The opposite margin of Gondwana, in Australia, faced a set of island arcs. [ 16 ] The accretion of these arcs to the eastern margin of Gondwana was responsible for the Benambran Orogeny of eastern Australia. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] Subduction also took place along what is now Argentina (Famatinian Orogeny) at 450 Ma. [ 30 ] This involved significant back arc rifting. [ 16 ] The interior of Gondwana was tectonically quiet until the Triassic . [ 16 ] 

Towards the end of the Ordovician, Gondwana began to drift across the South Pole; this contributed to the Hirnantian glaciation and the associated extinction event. [ 31 ] 

# Ordovician meteor event 
[ edit ] 

The Ordovician meteor event is a proposed shower of meteors that occurred during the Middle Ordovician Epoch, about 467.5 ± 0.28 million years ago, due to the break-up of the L chondrite parent body. [ 32 ] It is not associated with any major extinction event. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] A 2024 study found that craters from this event cluster in a distinct band around the Earth, and that the breakup of the parent body may have formed a ring system for a period of about 40 million years, with frequent falling debris causing these craters. [ 12 ] 

# Geochemistry 
[ edit ]

The Ordovician was a time of calcite sea geochemistry in which low-magnesium calcite was the primary inorganic marine precipitate of calcium carbonate . [ 36 ] Carbonate hardgrounds were thus very common, along with calcitic ooids , calcitic cements, and invertebrate faunas with dominantly calcitic skeletons. Biogenic aragonite , like that composing the shells of most molluscs , dissolved rapidly on the sea floor after death. [ 37 ] [ 38 ] 

Unlike Cambrian times, when calcite production was dominated by microbial and non-biological processes, animals (and macroalgae) became a dominant source of calcareous material in Ordovician deposits. [ 39 ] 

# Climate and sea level 
[ edit ] 

The Early Ordovician climate was very hot, [ 40 ] with intense greenhouse conditions and sea surface temperatures comparable to those during the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum. [ 41 ] Carbon dioxide levels were very high at the Ordovician period's beginning. [ 42 ] By the late Early Ordovician, the Earth cooled, [ 43 ] giving way to a more temperate climate in the Middle Ordovician, [ 44 ] with the Earth likely entering the Early Palaeozoic Ice Age during the Sandbian, [ 45 ] [ 46 ] and possibly as early as the Darriwilian [ 47 ] or even the Floian. [ 43 ] The Dapingian and Sandbian saw major humidification events evidenced by trace metal concentrations in Baltoscandia from this time. [ 48 ] Evidence suggests that global temperatures rose briefly in the early Katian (Boda Event), depositing bioherms and radiating fauna across Europe. [ 49 ] The early Katian also witnessed yet another humidification event. [ 48 ] Further cooling during the Hirnantian, at the end of the Ordovician, led to the Late Ordovician glaciation . [ 50 ] 

The Ordovician saw the highest sea levels of the Paleozoic, and the low relief of the continents led to many shelf deposits being formed under hundreds of metres of water. [ 39 ] The sea level rose more or less continuously throughout the Early Ordovician, leveling off somewhat during the middle of the period. [ 39 ] Locally, some regressions occurred, but the sea level rise continued in the beginning of the Late Ordovician. Sea levels fell steadily due to the cooling temperatures for about 3 million years leading up to the Hirnantian glaciation. During this icy stage, the sea level has risen and dropped somewhat. Despite much study, the details remain unresolved. [ 39 ] In particular, some researches interpret the fluctuations in sea level as pre-Hibernian glaciation, [ 51 ] but sedimentary evidence of glaciation is lacking until the end of the period. [ 21 ] There is evidence of glaciers during the Hirnantian on the land we now know as Africa and South America, which were near the South Pole at the time, facilitating the formation of the ice caps of the Hirnantian glaciation. 

As with North America and Europe , Gondwana was largely covered with shallow seas during the Ordovician. Shallow clear waters over continental shelves encouraged the growth of organisms that deposit calcium carbonates in their shells and hard parts. The Panthalassic Ocean covered much of the Northern Hemisphere , and other minor oceans included Proto-Tethys , Paleo-Tethys , Khanty Ocean , which was closed off by the Late Ordovician, Iapetus Ocean , and the new Rheic Ocean . 

# Life 
[ edit ] 
A diorama depicting Ordovician flora and fauna 

For most of the Late Ordovician life continued to flourish, but at and near the end of the period there were mass-extinction events that seriously affected conodonts and planktonic forms like graptolites . The trilobites Agnostida and Ptychopariida completely died out, and the Asaphida were much reduced. Brachiopods , bryozoans and echinoderms were also heavily affected, and the endocerid cephalopods died out completely, except for possible rare Silurian forms. The Ordovician–Silurian extinction events may have been caused by an ice age that occurred at the end of the Ordovician Period, due to the expansion of the first terrestrial plants , [ 52 ] as the end of the Late Ordovician was one of the coldest times in the last 600 million years of Earth's history. 

# Fauna

On the whole, the fauna that emerged in the Ordovician were the template for the remainder of the Palaeozoic. The fauna was dominated by tiered communities of suspension feeders, mainly with short food chains. The ecological system reached a new grade of complexity far beyond that of the Cambrian fauna, which has persisted until the present day. [ 39 ] Though less famous than the Cambrian explosion , the Ordovician radiation (also known as the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event) [ 16 ] was no less remarkable; marine faunal genera increased fourfold, resulting in 12% of all known Phanerozoic marine fauna. [ 53 ] Several animals also went through a miniaturization process, becoming much smaller than their Cambrian counterparts. [ citation needed ] Another change in the fauna was the strong increase in filter-feeding organisms. [ 54 ] The trilobite, inarticulate brachiopod, archaeocyathid , and eocrinoid faunas of the Cambrian were succeeded by those that dominated the rest of the Paleozoic, such as articulate brachiopods, cephalopods , and crinoids . Articulate brachiopods, in particular, largely replaced trilobites in shelf communities. Their success epitomizes the greatly increased diversity of carbonate shell-secreting organisms in the Ordovician compared to the Cambrian. [ 55 ]

Ordovician geography had its effect on the diversity of fauna; Ordovician invertebrates displayed a very high degree of provincialism. [ 56 ] The widely separated continents of Laurentia and Baltica, then positioned close to the tropics and boasting many shallow seas rich in life, developed distinct trilobite faunas from the trilobite fauna of Gondwana, [ 57 ] and Gondwana developed distinct fauna in its tropical and temperature zones. [ 58 ] The Tien Shan terrane maintained a biogeographic affinity with Gondwana, [ 59 ] and the Alborz margin of Gondwana was linked biogeographically to South China. [ 60 ] Southeast Asia's fauna also maintained strong affinities to Gondwana's. [ 61 ] North China was biogeographically connected to Laurentia and the Argentinian margin of Gondwana. [ 62 ] A Celtic biogeographic province also existed, separate from the Laurentian and Baltican ones. [ 63 ] However, tropical articulate brachiopods had a more cosmopolitan distribution , with less diversity on different continents. During the Middle Ordovician, beta diversity began a significant decline as marine taxa began to disperse widely across space. [ 64 ] Faunas become less provincial later in the Ordovician, partly due to the narrowing of the Iapetus Ocean, [ 65 ] though they were still distinguishable into the late Ordovician. [ 66 ]

Trilobites in particular were rich and diverse, and experienced rapid diversification in many regions. [ 67 ] Trilobites in the Ordovician were very different from their predecessors in the Cambrian. Many trilobites developed bizarre spines and nodules to defend against predators such as primitive eurypterids and nautiloids while other trilobites such as Aeglina prisca evolved to become swimming forms. Some trilobites even developed shovel-like snouts for ploughing through muddy sea bottoms. Another unusual clade of trilobites known as the trinucleids developed a broad pitted margin around their head shields. [ 68 ] Some trilobites such as Asaphus kowalewski evolved long eyestalks to assist in detecting predators whereas other trilobite eyes in contrast disappeared completely. [ 69 ] Molecular clock analyses suggest that early arachnids started living on land by the end of the Ordovician. [ 70 ] Although solitary corals date back to at least the Cambrian , reef -forming corals appeared in the early Ordovician, including the earliest known octocorals , [ 71 ] [ 72 ] corresponding to an increase in the stability of carbonate and thus a new abundance of calcifying animals. [ 39 ] Brachiopods surged in diversity, adapting to almost every type of marine environment. [ 73 ] [ 74 ] [ 75 ] Even after GOBE, there is evidence suggesting that Ordovician brachiopods maintained elevated rates of speciation. [ 76 ] Molluscs , which appeared during the Cambrian or even the Ediacaran , became common and varied, especially bivalves , gastropods , and nautiloid cephalopods. [ 77 ] [ 78 ] Cephalopods diversified from shallow marine tropical environments to dominate almost all marine environments. [ 79 ] Graptolites, which evolved in the preceding Cambrian period, thrived in the oceans. [ 80 ] This includes the distinctive Nemagraptus gracilis graptolite fauna, which was distributed widely during peak sea levels in the Sandbian. [ 81 ] [ 21 ] Some new cystoids and crinoids appeared. It was long thought that the first true vertebrates (fish — Ostracoderms ) appeared in the Ordovician, but recent discoveries in China reveal that they probably originated in the Early Cambrian . [ 82 ] The first gnathostome (jawed fish) may have appeared in the Late Ordovician epoch. [ 83 ] Chitinozoans, which first appeared late in the Wuliuan, exploded in diversity during the Tremadocian, quickly becoming globally widespread. [ 84 ] [ 85 ] Several groups of endobiotic symbionts appeared in the Ordovician. [ 86 ] [ 87 ] 

In the Early Ordovician, trilobites were joined by many new types of organisms, including tabulate corals, strophomenid , rhynchonellid , and many new orthid brachiopods, bryozoans, planktonic graptolites and conodonts, and many types of molluscs and echinoderms, including the ophiuroids ("brittle stars") and the first sea stars . Nevertheless, the arthropods remained abundant; all the Late Cambrian orders continued, and were joined by the new group Phacopida . The first evidence of land plants also appeared (see evolutionary history of life ). 

In the Middle Ordovician, the trilobite-dominated Early Ordovician communities were replaced by generally more mixed ecosystems, in which brachiopods, bryozoans, molluscs, cornulitids , tentaculitids and echinoderms all flourished, tabulate corals diversified and the first rugose corals appeared. The planktonic graptolites remained diverse, with the Diplograptina making their appearance. One of the earliest known armoured agnathan (" ostracoderm ") vertebrates, Arandaspis , dates from the Middle Ordovician. [ 88 ] During the Middle Ordovician there was a large increase in the intensity and diversity of bioeroding organisms. This is known as the Ordovician Bioerosion Revolution. [ 89 ] It is marked by a sudden abundance of hard substrate trace fossils such as Trypanites , Palaeosabella , Petroxestes and Osprioneides . Bioerosion became an important process, particularly in the thick calcitic skeletons of corals, bryozoans and brachiopods, and on the extensive carbonate hardgrounds that appear in abundance at this time.

# Flora 
[ edit ] 

Green algae were common in the Late Cambrian (perhaps earlier) and in the Ordovician. Terrestrial plants probably evolved from green algae, first appearing as tiny non- vascular forms resembling liverworts , in the middle to late Ordovician. [ 91 ] Fossil spores found in Ordovician sedimentary rock are typical of bryophytes. [ 92 ] 
Colonization of land would have been limited to shorelines 

Among the first land fungi may have been arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi ( Glomerales ), playing a crucial role in facilitating the colonization of land by plants through mycorrhizal symbiosis , which makes mineral nutrients available to plant cells; such fossilized fungal hyphae and spores from the Ordovician of Wisconsin have been found with an age of about 460 million years ago, a time when the land flora most likely only consisted of plants similar to non-vascular bryophytes . [ 93 ] 

# Microbiota

Though stromatolites had declined from their peak in the Proterozoic, they continued to exist in localised settings. [ 94 ] 

# End of the period 
[ edit ] 

Main article: Ordovician–Silurian extinction events 
The Anji Biota (Wenchang Formation, Zhejiang Province, China ) preserves abundant and diverse glass sponges and graptolites as well as rare examples of other marine animals (such as the eurypterid Archopterus ) living at a depth of several hundred metres. It is dated to just after the Hirnantian mass extinction at the end of the Ordovician period. [ 95 ] 

The Ordovician came to a close in a series of extinction events that, taken together, comprise the second largest of the five major extinction events in Earth's history in terms of percentage of genera that became extinct. The only larger one was the Permian–Triassic extinction event . 

The extinctions occurred approximately 447–444 million years ago and mark the boundary between the Ordovician and the following Silurian Period. At that time all complex multicellular organisms lived in the sea, and about 49% of genera of fauna disappeared forever; brachiopods and bryozoans were greatly reduced, along with many trilobite , conodont and graptolite families. 

The most commonly accepted theory is that these events were triggered by the onset of cold conditions in the late Katian, followed by an ice age , in the Hirnantian faunal stage, that ended the long, stable greenhouse conditions typical of the Ordovician. 

The ice age was possibly not long-lasting. Oxygen isotopes in fossil brachiopods show its duration may have been only 0.5 to 1.5 million years. [ 96 ] Other researchers (Page et al.) estimate more temperate conditions did not return until the late Silurian. 

The late Ordovician glaciation event was preceded by a fall in atmospheric carbon dioxide (from 7000 ppm to 4400 ppm). [ 97 ] [ 98 ] The dip may have been caused by a burst of volcanic activity that deposited new silicate rocks, which draw CO 2 out of the air as they erode. [ 98 ] Another possibility is that bryophytes and lichens, which colonized land in the middle to late Ordovician, may have increased weathering enough to draw down CO 2 levels. [ 91 ] The drop in CO 2 selectively affected the shallow seas where most organisms lived. It has also been suggested that shielding of the sun's rays from the proposed Ordovician ring system, which also caused the Ordovician meteor event , may have also led to the glaciation. [ 12 ] As the southern supercontinent Gondwana drifted over the South Pole, ice caps formed on it, which have been detected in Upper Ordovician rock strata of North Africa and then-adjacent northeastern South America, which were south-polar locations at the time. 

As glaciers grew, the sea level dropped, and the vast shallow intra-continental Ordovician seas withdrew, which eliminated many ecological niches. When they returned, they carried diminished founder populations that lacked many whole families of organisms. They then withdrew again with the next pulse of glaciation, eliminating biological diversity with each change. [ 99 ] Species limited to a single epicontinental sea on a given landmass were severely affected. [ 38 ] Tropical lifeforms were hit particularly hard in the first wave of extinction, while cool-water species were hit worst in the second pulse. [ 38 ] 

Those species able to adapt to the changing conditions survived to fill the ecological niches left by the extinctions. For example, there is evidence the oceans became more deeply oxygenated during the glaciation, allowing unusual benthic organisms (Hirnantian fauna) to colonize the depths. These organisms were cosmopolitan in distribution and present at most latitudes. [ 100 ] 

At the end of the second event, melting glaciers caused the sea level to rise and stabilise once more. The rebound of life's diversity with the permanent re-flooding of continental shelves at the onset of the Silurian saw increased biodiversity within the surviving Orders. Recovery was characterized by an unusual number of "Lazarus taxa", disappearing during the extinction and reappearing well into the Silurian, which suggests that the taxa survived in small numbers in refugia . [ 101 ] 

An alternate extinction hypothesis suggested that a ten-second gamma-ray burst could have destroyed the ozone layer and exposed terrestrial and marine surface-dwelling life to deadly ultraviolet radiation and initiated global cooling. [ 102 ] 

Recent work considering the sequence stratigraphy of the Late Ordovician argues that the mass extinction was a single protracted episode lasting several hundred thousand years, with abrupt changes in water depth and sedimentation rate producing two pulses of last occurrences of species. [ 103 ]

It should be called the Ordovician System, after this old British tribe."

The Silurian ( / s ɪ ˈ lj ʊər i . ən , s aɪ -/ sih- LURE -ee-ən, sy- ) [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] is a geologic period and system spanning 23.5 million years from the end of the Ordovician Period, at 443.1 Ma (million years ago) to the beginning of the Devonian Period, 419.62 Ma. [ 11 ] The Silurian is the third and shortest period of the Paleozoic Era, and the third of twelve periods of the Phanerozoic Eon. As with other geologic periods , the rock beds that define the period's start and end are well identified, but the exact dates are uncertain by a few million years. The base of the Silurian is set at a series of major Ordovician–Silurian extinction events when up to 60% of marine genera were wiped out. 

One important event in this period was the initial establishment of terrestrial life in what is known as the Silurian-Devonian Terrestrial Revolution : vascular plants emerged from more primitive land plants, [ 12 ] [ 13 ] dikaryan fungi started expanding and diversifying along with glomeromycotan fungi, [ 14 ] and three groups of arthropods ( myriapods , arachnids and hexapods ) became fully terrestrialized. [ 15 ] 

Another significant evolutionary milestone during the Silurian was the diversification of jawed fish , which include placoderms , acanthodians (which gave rise to cartilaginous fish ) and osteichthyan ( bony fish , further divided into lobe-finned and ray-finned fishes ), [ 16 ] although this corresponded to sharp decline of jawless fish such as conodonts and ostracoderms . 

# History of study 
[ edit ] 

The Silurian system was first identified by the Scottish geologist Roderick Murchison , who was examining fossil-bearing sedimentary rock strata in south Wales in the early 1830s. He named the sequences for a Celtic tribe of Wales, the Silures , inspired by his friend Adam Sedgwick , who had named the period of his study the Cambrian , from a Latin name for Wales. [ 17 ] Whilst the British rocks now identified as belonging to the Silurian System and the lands now thought to have been inhabited in antiquity by the Silures show little correlation ( cf . Geologic map of Wales , Map of pre-Roman tribes of Wales ), Murchison conjectured that their territory included Caer Caradoc and Wenlock Edge exposures - and that if it did not there were plenty of Silurian rocks elsewhere 'to sanction the name proposed'. [ 18 ] In 1835 the two men presented a joint paper, under the title On the Silurian and Cambrian Systems, Exhibiting the Order in which the Older Sedimentary Strata Succeed each other in England and Wales, which was the germ of the modern geological time scale . [ 19 ] As it was first identified, the "Silurian" series when traced farther afield quickly came to overlap Sedgwick's "Cambrian" sequence, however, provoking furious disagreements that ended the friendship. 

The English geologist Charles Lapworth resolved the conflict by defining a new Ordovician system including the contested beds. [ 20 ] An alternative name for the Silurian was "Gotlandian" after the strata of the Baltic island of Gotland . [ 21 ] 

The French geologist Joachim Barrande , building on Murchison's work, used the term Silurian in a more comprehensive sense than was justified by subsequent knowledge. He divided the Silurian rocks of Bohemia into eight stages. [ 22 ] His interpretation was questioned in 1854 by Edward Forbes , [ 23 ] and the later stages of Barrande; F, G and H have since been shown to be Devonian. Despite these modifications in the original groupings of the strata, it is recognized that Barrande established Bohemia as a classic ground for the study of the earliest Silurian fossils. 

# Subdivisions 
[ edit ] 
Subdivisions of the Silurian period Epoch Age Start (Ma) Etymology of Epochs and Stages Notes Llandovery Rhuddanian 443.8 Cefn-Rhuddan Farm, Llandovery in Carmarthenshire , Wales Aeronian 440.8 Cwm Coed-Aeron Farm, Wales Trefawr Track near the farm is the site of the GSSP Telychian 438.5 Pen-lan-Telych Farm, Llandovery, Wales Wenlock Sheinwoodian 433.4 Sheinwood village, Much Wenlock and Wenlock Edge , Shropshire , England During the Wenlock, the oldest-known tracheophytes of the genus Cooksonia , appear. The complexity of slightly later Gondwana plants like Baragwanathia , which resembled a modern clubmoss, indicates a much longer history for vascular plants, extending into the early Silurian or even Ordovician . [ citation needed ] The first terrestrial animals also appear in the Wenlock, represented by air-breathing millipedes from Scotland . [ 24 ] Homerian 430.5 Homer, Shropshire , England Ludlow Gorstian 427.4 Gorsty village near Ludlow , Shropshire, England Ludfordian 425.6 Ludford, Shropshire , England Přídolí — 423.0 Named after a locality at the Homolka a Přídolí nature reserve near the Prague suburb of Slivenec , Czech Republic . Přídolí is the old name of a cadastral field area. [ 25 ]

Ordovician -Silurian boundary on Hovedøya , Norway , showing brownish late Ordovician mudstone and later dark deep-water Silurian shale . The layers have been overturned by the Caledonian orogeny . 

With the supercontinent Gondwana covering the equator and much of the southern hemisphere, a large ocean occupied most of the northern half of the globe. [ 26 ] The high sea levels of the Silurian and the relatively flat land (with few significant mountain belts) resulted in a number of island chains, and thus a rich diversity of environmental settings. [ 26 ] 

During the Silurian, Gondwana continued a slow southward drift to high southern latitudes, but there is evidence that the Silurian icecaps were less extensive than those of the late-Ordovician glaciation. The southern continents remained united during this period. The melting of icecaps and glaciers contributed to a rise in sea level, recognizable from the fact that Silurian sediments overlie eroded Ordovician sediments, forming an unconformity . The continents of Avalonia , Baltica , and Laurentia drifted together near the equator , starting the formation of a second supercontinent known as Euramerica . 

When the proto-Europe collided with North America, the collision folded coastal sediments that had been accumulating since the Cambrian off the east coast of North America and the west coast of Europe. This event is the Caledonian orogeny , a spate of mountain building that stretched from New York State through conjoined Europe and Greenland to Norway. At the end of the Silurian, sea levels dropped again, leaving telltale basins of evaporites extending from Michigan to West Virginia, and the new mountain ranges were rapidly eroded. The Teays River , flowing into the shallow mid-continental sea, eroded Ordovician Period strata, forming deposits of Silurian strata in northern Ohio and Indiana. 

The vast ocean of Panthalassa covered most of the northern hemisphere. Other minor oceans include two phases of the Tethys, the Proto-Tethys and Paleo-Tethys , the Rheic Ocean , the Iapetus Ocean (a narrow seaway between Avalonia and Laurentia), and the newly formed Ural Ocean .

# Climate and sea level 
[ edit ] 

The Silurian period was once believed to have enjoyed relatively stable and warm temperatures, in contrast with the extreme glaciations of the Ordovician before it and the extreme heat of the ensuing Devonian; however, it is now known that the global climate underwent many drastic fluctuations throughout the Silurian, [ 27 ] [ 28 ] evidenced by numerous major carbon and oxygen isotope excursions during this geologic period. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Sea levels rose from their Hirnantian low throughout the first half of the Silurian; they subsequently fell throughout the rest of the period, although smaller scale patterns are superimposed on this general trend; fifteen high-stands (periods when sea levels were above the edge of the continental shelf) can be identified, and the highest Silurian sea level was probably around 140 metres (459 ft) higher than the lowest level reached. [ 26 ] 

During this period, the Earth entered a warm greenhouse phase, supported by high CO 2 levels of 4500 ppm, and warm shallow seas covered much of the equatorial land masses. [ 32 ] Early in the Silurian, glaciers retreated back into the South Pole until they almost disappeared in the middle of Silurian. [ 28 ] Layers of broken shells (called coquina ) provide strong evidence of a climate dominated by violent storms generated then as now by warm sea surfaces. [ 33 ] 

# Perturbations 
[ edit ] 

The climate and carbon cycle appear to be rather unsettled during the Silurian, which had a higher frequency of isotopic excursions (indicative of climate fluctuations) than any other period. [ 26 ] The Ireviken event , Mulde event , and Lau event each represent isotopic excursions following a minor mass extinction [ 34 ] and associated with rapid sea-level change. Each one leaves a similar signature in the geological record, both geochemically and biologically; pelagic (free-swimming) organisms were particularly hard hit, as were brachiopods , corals , and trilobites , and extinctions rarely occur in a rapid series of fast bursts. [ 26 ] [ 31 ] The climate fluctuations are best explained by a sequence of glaciations, but the lack of tillites in the middle to late Silurian make this explanation problematic. [ 35 ] 

# Flora and fauna 
[ edit ] 

Main article: Silurian-Devonian Terrestrial Revolution 

The Silurian period has been viewed by some palaeontologists as an extended recovery interval following the Late Ordovician mass extinction (LOME), which interrupted the cascading increase in biodiversity that had continuously gone on throughout the Cambrian and most of the Ordovician. [ 36 ] 

The Silurian was the first period to see megafossils of extensive terrestrial biota in the form of moss -like miniature forests along lakes and streams and networks of large, mycorrhizal nematophytes , heralding the beginning of the Silurian-Devonian Terrestrial Revolution. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 37 ] However, the land fauna did not have a major impact on the Earth until it diversified in the Devonian. [ 26 ] 
Diorama of a Silurian seafloor 

The first fossil records of vascular plants , that is, land plants with tissues that carry water and food, appeared in the second half of the Silurian Period. [ 38 ] The earliest-known representatives of this group are Cooksonia . Most of the sediments containing Cooksonia are marine in nature. Preferred habitats were likely along rivers and streams. Baragwanathia appears to be almost as old, dating to the early Ludlow (420 Ma) [ needs update? ] and has branching stems and needle-like leaves of 10–20 centimetres (3.9–7.9 in). The plant shows a high degree of development in relation to the age of its fossil remains. Fossils of this plant have been recorded in Australia, [ 39 ] [ 40 ] Canada, [ 41 ] and China. [ 42 ] Eohostimella heathana is an early, probably terrestrial, "plant" known from compression fossils [ 43 ] of Early Silurian (Llandovery) age. [ 44 ] The chemistry of its fossils is similar to that of fossilised vascular plants, rather than algae. [ 43 ] 

Fossils that are considered as terrestrial animals are also known from the Silurian. The definitive oldest record of millipede ever known is Kampecaris obanensis and Archidesmus sp. from the late Silurian (425 Ma) of Kerrera . [ 45 ] There are also other millipedes, centipedes , and trigonotarbid arachnoids known from Ludlow (420 Ma). [ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] Predatory invertebrates would indicate that simple food webs were in place that included non-predatory prey animals. Extrapolating back from Early Devonian biota, Andrew Jeram et al. in 1990 [ 48 ] suggested a food web based on as-yet-undiscovered detritivores and grazers on micro-organisms. [ 49 ] Millipedes from Cowie Formation such as Cowiedesmus and Pneumodesmus were considered as the oldest millipede from the middle Silurian at 428–430 Ma, [ 24 ] [ 50 ] [ 51 ] although the age of this formation is later reinterpreted to be from the early Devonian instead by some researchers. [ 52 ] [ 53 ] Regardless, Pneumodesmus is still an important fossil as the oldest definitive evidence of spiracles to breathe in the air. [ 45 ]

The first bony fish, the Osteichthyes , appeared, represented by the Acanthodians covered with bony scales. Fish reached considerable diversity and developed movable jaws , adapted from the supports of the front two or three gill arches. A diverse fauna of eurypterids (sea scorpions)—some of them a few meters in length—prowled the shallow Silurian seas and lakes of North America; many of their fossils have been found in New York state . Brachiopods were abundant and diverse, with the taxonomic composition, ecology, and biodiversity of Silurian brachiopods mirroring Ordovician ones. [ 54 ] Brachiopods that survived the LOME developed novel adaptations for environmental stress, [ 55 ] and they tended to be endemic to a single palaeoplate in the mass extinction's aftermath, but expanded their range afterwards. [ 56 ] The most abundant brachiopods were atrypids and pentamerides; [ 57 ] atrypids were the first to recover and rediversify in the Rhuddanian after LOME, [ 58 ] while pentameride recovery was delayed until the Aeronian. [ 57 ] Bryozoans exhibited significant degrees of endemism to a particular shelf. [ 59 ] They also developed symbiotic relationships with cnidarians [ 60 ] and stromatolites. [ 61 ] Many bivalve fossils have also been found in Silurian deposits, [ 62 ] and the first deep-boring bivalves are known from this period. [ 63 ] Chitons saw a peak in diversity during the middle of the Silurian. [ 64 ] Hederelloids enjoyed significant success in the Silurian, with some developing symbioses with the colonial rugose coral Entelophyllum . [ 65 ] The Silurian was a heyday for tentaculitoids , [ 66 ] which experienced an evolutionary radiation focused mainly in Baltoscandia, [ 67 ] along with an expansion of their geographic range in the Llandovery and Wenlock. [ 68 ] Trilobites started to recover in the Rhuddanian, [ 69 ] and they continued to enjoy success in the Silurian as they had in the Ordovician despite their reduction in clade diversity as a result of LOME. [ 70 ] The Early Silurian was a chaotic time of turnover for crinoids as they rediversified after LOME. [ 71 ] Members of Flexibilia, which were minimally impacted by LOME, took on an increasing ecological prominence in Silurian seas. [ 72 ] Monobathrid camerates, like flexibles, diversified in the Llandovery, whereas cyathocrinids and dendrocrinids diversified later in the Silurian. [ 73 ] Scyphocrinoid loboliths suddenly appeared in the terminal Silurian, shortly before the Silurian-Devonian boundary, and disappeared as abruptly as they appeared very shortly after their first appearance. [ 74 ] Endobiotic symbionts were common in the corals and stromatoporoids. [ 75 ] [ 76 ] Rugose corals especially were colonised and encrusted by a diverse range of epibionts, [ 77 ] including certain hederelloids as aforementioned. [ 65 ] Photosymbiotic scleractinians made their first appearance during the Middle Silurian. [ 78 ] Reef abundance was patchy; sometimes, fossils are frequent, but at other points, are virtually absent from the rock record. [ 26 ]

The Devonian ( / d ə ˈ v oʊ n i . ən , d ɛ -/ də- VOH -nee-ən, deh- ) [ 9 ] [ 10 ] is a geologic period and system of the Paleozoic era during the Phanerozoic eon , spanning 60.3 million years from the end of the preceding Silurian period at 419.62 million years ago ( Ma ), to the beginning of the succeeding Carboniferous period at 358.86 Ma. It is the fourth period of both the Paleozoic and the Phanerozoic. [ 11 ] It is named after Devon , South West England , where rocks from this period were first studied. 

The first significant evolutionary radiation of life on land occurred during the Devonian, as free- sporing land plants ( pteridophytes ) began to spread across dry land , forming extensive coal forests which covered the continents. By the middle of the Devonian, several groups of vascular plants had evolved leaves and true roots , and by the end of the period the first seed -bearing plants ( pteridospermatophytes ) appeared. This rapid evolution and colonization process, which had begun during the Silurian, is known as the Silurian-Devonian Terrestrial Revolution . The earliest land animals , predominantly arthropods such as myriapods , arachnids and hexapods , also became well-established early in this period, after beginning their colonization of land at least from the Ordovician Period. 

Fishes , especially jawed fish , reached substantial diversity during this time, leading the Devonian to be called the Age of Fishes . The armored placoderms began dominating almost every known aquatic environment. In the oceans, cartilaginous fishes such as primitive sharks became more numerous than in the Silurian and Late Ordovician . Tetrapodomorphs , which include the ancestors of all four- limbed vertebrates (i.e. tetrapods ), began diverging from freshwater lobe-finned fish as their more robust and muscled pectoral and pelvic fins gradually evolved into forelimbs and hindlimbs , though they were not fully established for life on land until the Late Carboniferous . [ 12 ] 

The first ammonites , a subclass of cephalopod molluscs , appeared. Trilobites , brachiopods and the great coral reefs were still common during the Devonian. The Late Devonian extinction , which started about 375 Ma, [ 13 ] severely affected marine life, killing off most of the reef systems, most of the jawless fish, the placoderms, and nearly all trilobites save for a few species of the order Proetida . The subsequent end-Devonian extinction , which occurred at around 359 Ma, further impacted the ecosystems and completed the extinction of all calcite sponge reefs and placoderms. 

Devonian palaeogeography was dominated by the supercontinent Gondwana to the south, the small continent of Siberia to the north, and the medium-sized continent of Laurussia to the east. Major tectonic events include the closure of the Rheic Ocean , the separation of South China from Gondwana, and the resulting expansion of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean . The Devonian experienced several major mountain-building events as Laurussia and Gondwana approached; these include the Acadian Orogeny in North America and the beginning of the Variscan Orogeny in Europe. These early collisions preceded the formation of the single supercontinent Pangaea in the Late Paleozoic. 

# History 
[ edit ] 
The rocks of Lummaton Quarry in Torquay in Devon played an early role in defining the Devonian Period 

The period is named after Devon , a county in southwestern England, where a controversial argument in the 1830s over the age and structure of the rocks found throughout the county was resolved by adding the Devonian Period to the geological timescale. The Great Devonian Controversy was a lengthy debate between Roderick Murchison , Adam Sedgwick and Henry De la Beche over the naming of the period. Murchison and Sedgwick won the debate and named it the Devonian System. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ a ] 

While the rock beds that define the start and end of the Devonian Period are well identified, the exact dates are uncertain. According to the International Commission on Stratigraphy , [ 19 ] the Devonian extends from the end of the Silurian 419.62 Ma, to the beginning of the Carboniferous 358.86 Ma – in North America , at the beginning of the Mississippian subperiod of the Carboniferous. 

In 19th-century texts, the Devonian has been called the "Old Red Age", after the red and brown terrestrial deposits known in the United Kingdom as the Old Red Sandstone in which early fossil discoveries were found. Another common term is "Age of the Fishes", [ 20 ] referring to the evolution of several major groups of fish that took place during the period. Older literature on the Anglo-Welsh basin divides it into the Downtonian, Dittonian, Breconian, and Farlovian stages, the latter three of which are placed in the Devonian. [ 21 ] 

The Devonian has also erroneously been characterised as a "greenhouse age", due to sampling bias : most of the early Devonian-age discoveries came from the strata of Western Europe and eastern North America , which at the time straddled the Equator as part of the supercontinent of Euramerica where fossil signatures of widespread reefs indicate tropical climates that were warm and moderately humid. In fact, the climate in the Devonian differed greatly during its epochs and between geographic regions. For example, during the Early Devonian, arid conditions were prevalent through much of the world including Siberia, Australia, North America, and China, but Africa and South America had a warm temperate climate . In the Late Devonian, by contrast, arid conditions were less prevalent across the world and temperate climates were more common. [ citation needed ] 

# Subdivisions 
[ edit ] 

The Devonian Period is formally broken into Early, Middle and Late subdivisions. The rocks corresponding to those epochs are referred to as belonging to the Lower, Middle and Upper parts of the Devonian System. 

# Early Devonian 
[ edit ] 
A map of Earth in the Emsian stage of the Early Devonian (405 million years ago) 

The Early Devonian lasted from 419.62 to 393.47 Ma. It began with the Lochkovian Stage from 419.62 to 413.02 Ma, which was followed by the Pragian from 413.02 to 410.62 Ma and then by the Emsian , which lasted until the Middle Devonian began at 393.47 Ma. [ 22 ] During this time, the first ammonoids appeared, descending from bactritoid nautiloids . Ammonoids during this time period were simple and differed little from their nautiloid counterparts. These ammonoids belong to the order Agoniatitida , which in later epochs evolved to new ammonoid orders, for example Goniatitida and Clymeniida . This class of cephalopod molluscs would dominate the marine fauna until the beginning of the Mesozoic Era. 

# Middle Devonian 
[ edit ] 

The Middle Devonian comprised two subdivisions: first the Eifelian , which then gave way to the Givetian at 387.95 Ma. During this time, the jawless agnathan fishes began to decline in diversity in freshwater and marine environments partly due to drastic environmental changes and partly due to the increasing competition, predation, and diversity of jawed fishes . The shallow, warm, oxygen-depleted waters of Devonian inland lakes, surrounded by primitive plants, provided the environment necessary for certain early fish to develop such essential characteristics as well developed lungs and the ability to crawl out of the water and onto the land for short periods of time. [ 23 ] 

# Late Devonian 
[ edit ] 
A map of Earth in the Famennian stage of the Late Devonian (370 million years ago) 

Finally, the Late Devonian started with the Frasnian , from 382.31 to 372.15 Ma, during which the first forests took shape on land. The first tetrapods appeared in the fossil record in the ensuing Famennian subdivision, the beginning and end of which are marked with extinction events. This lasted until the end of the Devonian at 358.86 Ma. [ 22 ] 

# Climate 
[ edit ] 

The Devonian was a relatively warm period, although significant glaciers may have existed during the Early and Middle Devonian. [ 24 ] The temperature gradient from the equator to the poles was not as large as it is today. The weather was also very arid, mostly along the equator where it was the driest. [ 25 ] Reconstruction of tropical sea surface temperature from conodont apatite implies an average value of 30 °C (86 °F) in the Early Devonian. [ 25 ] Early Devonian mean annual surface temperatures were approximately 16 °C. [ 26 ] CO 2 levels dropped steeply throughout the Devonian Period. The newly evolved forests drew carbon out of the atmosphere, which were then buried into sediments. This may be reflected by a Mid-Devonian cooling of around 5 °C (9 °F). [ 25 ] The Late Devonian warmed to levels equivalent to the Early Devonian; while there is no corresponding increase in CO 2 concentrations, continental weathering increases (as predicted by warmer temperatures); further, a range of evidence, such as plant distribution, points to a Late Devonian warming. [ 25 ] The climate would have affected the dominant organisms in reefs ; microbes would have been the main reef-forming organisms in warm periods, with corals and stromatoporoid sponges taking the dominant role in cooler times. The warming at the end of the Devonian may even have contributed to the extinction of the stromatoporoids. At the terminus of the Devonian, Earth rapidly cooled into an icehouse , marking the beginning of the Late Paleozoic icehouse . [ 27 ] [ 28 ] 

# Paleogeography 
[ edit ] 

The Devonian world involved many continents and ocean basins of various sizes. The largest continent, Gondwana , was located entirely within the Southern Hemisphere . It corresponds to modern day South America , Africa , Australia , Antarctica , and India , as well as minor components of North America and Asia . The second-largest continent, Laurussia, was northwest of Gondwana, and corresponds to much of modern-day North America and Europe . Various smaller continents, microcontinents , and terranes were present east of Laurussia and north of Gondwana, corresponding to parts of Europe and Asia. The Devonian Period was a time of great tectonic activity, as the major continents of Laurussia and Gondwana drew closer together. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] 

Sea levels were high worldwide, and much of the land lay under shallow seas, where tropical reef organisms lived. The enormous "world ocean", Panthalassa , occupied much of the Northern Hemisphere as well as wide swathes east of Gondwana and west of Laurussia. Other minor oceans were the Paleo-Tethys Ocean and Rheic Ocean . [ 29 ] [ 30 ] 

# Laurussia 
[ edit ] 
Continental boundary of Laurussia (Euramerica) and its constituents, superimposed onto modern coastlines 

By the early Devonian, the continent Laurussia (also known as Euramerica ) was fully formed through the collision of the continents Laurentia (modern day North America) and Baltica (modern day northern and eastern Europe). The tectonic effects of this collision continued into the Devonian, producing a string of mountain ranges along the southeastern coast of the continent. In present-day eastern North America, the Acadian Orogeny continued to raise the Appalachian Mountains . Further east, the collision also extended the rise of the Caledonian Mountains of Great Britain and Scandinavia . As the Caledonian Orogeny wound down in the later part of the period, orogenic collapse facilitated a cluster of granite intrusions in Scotland. [ 29 ] 

Most of Laurussia was located south of the equator, but in the Devonian it moved northwards and began to rotate counterclockwise towards its modern position. While the most northern parts of the continent (such as Greenland and Ellesmere Island ) established tropical conditions, most of the continent was located within the natural dry zone along the Tropic of Capricorn , which (as nowadays) is a result of the convergence of two great air-masses, the Hadley cell and the Ferrel cell . In these near-deserts, the Old Red Sandstone sedimentary beds formed, made red by the oxidised iron ( hematite ) characteristic of drought conditions. The abundance of red sandstone on continental land also lends Laurussia the name "the Old Red Continent". [ 31 ] For much of the Devonian, the majority of western Laurussia (North America) was covered by subtropical inland seas which hosted a diverse ecosystem of reefs and marine life. Devonian marine deposits are particularly prevalent in the midwestern and northeastern United States. Devonian reefs also extended along the southeast edge of Laurussia, a coastline now corresponding to southern England , Belgium , and other mid-latitude areas of Europe. [ 29 ] 

In the Early and Middle Devonian, the west coast of Laurussia was a passive margin with broad coastal waters, deep silty embayments, river deltas and estuaries, found today in Idaho and Nevada . In the Late Devonian, an approaching volcanic island arc reached the steep slope of the continental shelf and began to uplift deep water deposits. This minor collision sparked the start of a mountain-building episode called the Antler orogeny , which extended into the Carboniferous. [ 29 ] [ 32 ] Mountain building could also be found in the far northeastern extent of the continent, as minor tropical island arcs and detached Baltic terranes re-join the continent. Deformed remnants of these mountains can still be found on Ellesmere Island and Svalbard . Many of the Devonian collisions in Laurussia produce both mountain chains and foreland basins , which are frequently fossiliferous. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] 

# Gondwana 
[ edit ] 
The Early-Middle Devonian world, with major continents Gondwana (Go), Euramerica/Laurussia (Eu), and Siberia (Si) 

Gondwana was by far the largest continent on the planet. It was completely south of the equator, although the northeastern sector (now Australia) did reach tropical latitudes. The southwestern sector (now South America) was located to the far south, with Brazil situated near the South Pole . The northwestern edge of Gondwana was an active margin for much of the Devonian, and saw the accretion of many smaller land masses and island arcs. These include Chilenia , Cuyania , and Chaitenia , which now form much of Chile and Patagonia . [ 29 ] [ 33 ] These collisions were associated with volcanic activity and plutons , but by the Late Devonian the tectonic situation had relaxed and much of South America was covered by shallow seas. These south polar seas hosted a distinctive brachiopod fauna, the Malvinokaffric Realm, which extended eastward to marginal areas now equivalent to South Africa and Antarctica. Malvinokaffric faunas even managed to approach the South Pole via a tongue of Panthalassa which extended into the Paraná Basin . [ 29 ] 

The northern rim of Gondwana was mostly a passive margin, hosting extensive marine deposits in areas such as northwest Africa and Tibet . The eastern margin, though warmer than the west, was equally active. Numerous mountain building events and granite and kimberlite intrusions affected areas equivalent to modern day eastern Australia , Tasmania , and Antarctica. [ 29 ] 

# Asian terranes 
[ edit ] 
The earth at 380 Ma, centered on the Paleo-Tethys Ocean , which fully opened during the Devonian 

Several island microcontinents (which would later coalesce into modern day Asia) stretched over a low-latitude archipelago to the north of Gondwana. They were separated from the southern continent by an oceanic basin: the Paleo-Tethys . Although the western Paleo-Tethys Ocean had existed since the Cambrian, the eastern part only began to rift apart as late as the Silurian. This process accelerated in the Devonian. The eastern branch of the Paleo-Tethys was fully opened when South China and Annamia (a terrane equivalent to most of Indochina ), together as a unified continent, detached from the northeastern sector of Gondwana. Nevertheless, they remained close enough to Gondwana that their Devonian fossils were more closely related to Australian species than to north Asian species. Other Asian terranes remained attached to Gondwana, including Sibumasu (western Indochina), Tibet, and the rest of the Cimmerian blocks. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] 
World map at 400 Ma (Early Devonian), showing continents and terranes with modern continent borders superimposed 

While the South China-Annamia continent was the newest addition to the Asian microcontinents, it was not the first. North China and the Tarim Block (now northwesternmost China) were located westward and continued to drift northwards, powering over older oceanic crust in the process. Further west was a small ocean (the Turkestan Ocean), followed by the larger microcontinents of Kazakhstania , Siberia , and Amuria . Kazakhstania was a volcanically active region during the Devonian, as it continued to assimilate smaller island arcs. [ 29 ] The island arcs of the region, such as the Balkhash-West Junggar Arc, exhibited biological endemism as a consequence of their location. [ 34 ] 

Siberia was located just north of the equator as the largest landmass in the Northern Hemisphere. At the beginning of the Devonian, Siberia was inverted (upside down) relative to its modern orientation. Later in the period it moved northwards and began to twist clockwise, though it was not near its modern location. Siberia approached the eastern edge of Laurussia as the Devonian progressed, but it was still separated by a seaway, the Ural Ocean . Although Siberia's margins were generally tectonically stable and ecologically productive, rifting and deep mantle plumes impacted the continent with flood basalts during the Late Devonian. The Altai-Sayan region was shaken by volcanism in the Early and Middle Devonian, while Late Devonian magmatism was magnified further to produce the Vilyuy Traps , flood basalts which may have contributed to the Late Devonian Mass Extinction. The last major round of volcanism, the Yakutsk Large Igneous Province, continued into the Carboniferous to produce extensive kimberlite deposits. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] 

Similar volcanic activity also affected the nearby microcontinent of Amuria (now Manchuria , Mongolia , and their vicinities). Though certainly close to Siberia in the Devonian, the precise location of Amuria is uncertain due to contradictory paleomagnetic data. [ 29 ] 

# Closure of the Rheic Ocean 
[ edit ] 

The Rheic Ocean, which separated Laurussia from Gondwana, was wide at the start of the Devonian, having formed after the drift of Avalonia away from Gondwana. It steadily shrunk as the period continued, as the two major continents approached near the equator in the early stages of the assembly of Pangaea . The closure of the Rheic Ocean began in the Devonian and continued into the Carboniferous. As the ocean narrowed, endemic marine faunas of Gondwana and Laurussia combined into a single tropical fauna. The history of the western Rheic Ocean is a subject of debate, but there is good evidence that Rheic oceanic crust experienced intense subduction and metamorphism under Mexico and Central America. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] 

The closure of the eastern part of the Rheic Ocean is associated with the assemblage of central and southern Europe. In the early Paleozoic, much of Europe was still attached to Gondwana, including the terranes of Iberia , Armorica (France), Palaeo-Adria (the western Mediterranean area), Bohemia , Franconia , and Saxothuringia . These continental blocks, collectively known as the Armorican Terrane Assemblage, split away from Gondwana in the Silurian and drifted towards Laurussia through the Devonian. Their collision with Laurussia leads to the beginning of the Variscan Orogeny , a major mountain-building event which would escalate further in the Late Paleozoic. Franconia and Saxothuringia collided with Laurussia near the end of the Early Devonian, pinching out the easternmost Rheic Ocean. The rest of the Armorican terranes followed, and by the end of the Devonian they were fully connected with Laurussia. This sequence of rifting and collision events led to the successive creation and destruction of several small seaways, including the Rheno-Hercynian, Saxo-Thuringian, and Galicia-Moldanubian oceans. Their sediments were eventually compressed and completely buried as Gondwana fully collided with Laurussia in the Carboniferous. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 35 ]

See also: Evolution of fish § Devonian: Age of fishes 

Sea levels in the Devonian were generally high. Marine faunas continued to be dominated by conodonts , [ 37 ] bryozoans , [ 38 ] diverse and abundant brachiopods , [ 39 ] the enigmatic hederellids , [ 40 ] microconchids , [ 38 ] and corals . [ 41 ] [ 42 ] Lily-like crinoids (animals, their resemblance to flowers notwithstanding) were abundant, and trilobites were still fairly common. Bivalves became commonplace in deep water and outer shelf environments. [ 43 ] The first ammonites also appeared during or slightly before the early Devonian Period around 400 Ma. [ 44 ] Bactritoids make their first appearance in the Early Devonian as well; their radiation, along with that of ammonoids, has been attributed by some authors to increased environmental stress resulting from decreasing oxygen levels in the deeper parts of the water column. [ 45 ] Among vertebrates, jawless armored fish ( ostracoderms ) declined in diversity, while the jawed fish (gnathostomes) simultaneously increased in both the sea and fresh water . Armored placoderms were numerous during the early ages of the Devonian Period and became extinct in the Late Devonian, perhaps because of competition for food against the other fish species. Early cartilaginous ( Chondrichthyes ) and bony fishes ( Osteichthyes ) also become diverse and played a large role within the Devonian seas. The first abundant genus of cartilaginous fish, Cladoselache , appeared in the oceans during the Devonian Period. The great diversity of fish around at the time has led to the Devonian being given the name "The Age of Fishes" in popular culture. [ 46 ] 
The Devonian period saw the development of early sharks, armoured placoderms and various lobe-finned fishes including the tetrapod transitional species 

The Devonian saw significant expansion in the diversity of nektonic marine life driven by the abundance of planktonic microorganisms in the free water column as well as high ecological competition in benthic habitats, which were extremely saturated; this diversification has been labeled the Devonian Nekton Revolution by many researchers. [ 47 ] However, other researchers have questioned whether this revolution existed at all; a 2018 study found that although the proportion of biodiversity constituted by nekton increased across the boundary between the Silurian and Devonian, it decreased across the span of the Devonian, particularly during the Pragian, and that the overall diversity of nektonic taxa did not increase significantly during the Devonian compared to during other geologic periods, and was in fact higher during the intervals spanning from the Wenlock to the Lochkovian and from the Carboniferous to the Permian. The study's authors instead attribute the increased overall diversity of nekton in the Devonian to a broader, gradual trend of nektonic diversification across the entire Palaeozoic. [ 48 ] 

# Reefs 
[ edit ] 

A now-dry barrier reef, located in present-day Kimberley Basin of northwest Australia , once extended 350 km (220 mi), fringing a Devonian continent. [ 49 ] Reefs are generally built by various carbonate -secreting organisms that can erect wave-resistant structures near sea level. Although modern reefs are constructed mainly by corals and calcareous algae , Devonian reefs were either microbial reefs built up mostly by autotrophic cyanobacteria or coral-stromatoporoid reefs built up by coral-like stromatoporoids and tabulate and rugose corals . Microbial reefs dominated under the warmer conditions of the early and late Devonian, while coral-stromatoporoid reefs dominated during the cooler middle Devonian. [ 50 ] 

# Terrestrial biota 
[ edit ] 
Prototaxites milwaukeensis , a large fungus, initially thought to be a marine alga, from the Middle Devonian of Wisconsin 

By the Devonian Period, life was well underway in its colonization of the land. The moss forests and bacterial and algal mats of the Silurian were joined early in the period by primitive rooted plants that created the first stable soils and harbored arthropods like mites , scorpions , trigonotarbids [ 51 ] and myriapods (although arthropods appeared on land much earlier than in the Early Devonian [ 52 ] and the existence of fossils such as Protichnites suggest that amphibious arthropods may have appeared as early as the Cambrian ). By far the largest land organism at the beginning of this period was the enigmatic Prototaxites , which was possibly the fruiting body of an enormous fungus, [ 53 ] rolled liverwort mat, [ 54 ] or another organism of uncertain affinities [ 55 ] that stood more than 8 metres (26 ft) tall, and towered over the low, carpet-like vegetation during the early part of the Devonian. Also, the first possible fossils of insects appeared around 416  Ma, in the Early Devonian. Evidence for the earliest tetrapods takes the form of trace fossils in shallow lagoon environments within a marine carbonate platform/shelf during the Middle Devonian, [ 56 ] although these traces have been questioned and an interpretation as fish feeding traces ( Piscichnus ) has been advanced. [ 57 ] 

# The greening of land 
[ edit ] 

Main article: Devonian explosion 
The Devonian Period marks the beginning of extensive land colonization by plants . With large land-dwelling herbivores not yet present, large forests grew and shaped the landscape. 

Many Early Devonian plants did not have true roots or leaves like extant plants, although vascular tissue is observed in many of those plants. Some of the early land plants such as Drepanophycus likely spread by vegetative growth and spores. [ 58 ] The earliest land plants such as Cooksonia consisted of leafless, dichotomous axes with terminal sporangia and were generally very short-statured, and grew hardly more than a few centimetres tall. [ 59 ] Fossils of Armoricaphyton chateaupannense , about 400 million years old, represent the oldest known plants with woody tissue. [ 60 ] By the Middle Devonian, shrub-like forests of primitive plants existed: lycophytes , horsetails , ferns , and progymnosperms evolved. Most of these plants had true roots and leaves, and many were quite tall. The earliest-known trees appeared in the Middle Devonian. [ 61 ] These included a lineage of lycopods and another arborescent, woody vascular plant, the cladoxylopsids and progymnosperm Archaeopteris . [ 62 ] These tracheophytes were able to grow to large size on dry land because they had evolved the ability to biosynthesize lignin , which gave them physical rigidity and improved the effectiveness of their vascular system while giving them resistance to pathogens and herbivores. [ 63 ] In Eifelian age, cladoxylopsid trees formed the first forests in Earth history. [ 64 ] By the end of the Devonian, the first seed-forming plants had appeared. This rapid appearance of many plant groups and growth forms has been referred to as the Devonian Explosion or the Silurian-Devonian Terrestrial Revolution. [ 65 ] 

The 'greening' of the continents acted as a carbon sink , and atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide may have dropped. This may have cooled the climate and led to a massive extinction event . ( See Late Devonian extinction ).

# Animals and the first soils 
[ edit ] 

Primitive arthropods co-evolved with this diversified terrestrial vegetation structure. The evolving co-dependence of insects and seed plants that characterized a recognizably modern world had its genesis in the Late Devonian Epoch. The development of soils and plant root systems probably led to changes in the speed and pattern of erosion and sediment deposition. The rapid evolution of a terrestrial ecosystem that contained copious animals opened the way for the first vertebrates to seek terrestrial living. By the end of the Devonian, arthropods were solidly established on the land. [ 66 ]

# Late Devonian extinction 
[ edit ] 

Main article: Late Devonian extinction 
The Late Devonian is characterised by three episodes of extinction ("Late D") 

The Late Devonian extinction is not a single event, but rather is a series of pulsed extinctions at the Givetian-Frasnian boundary, the Frasnian-Famennian boundary, and the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary. [ 67 ] Together, these are considered one of the " Big Five " mass extinctions in Earth's history. [ 68 ] The Devonian extinction crisis primarily affected the marine community, and selectively affected shallow warm-water organisms rather than cool-water organisms. The most important group to be affected by this extinction event were the reef-builders of the great Devonian reef systems. [ 69 ] 

Amongst the severely affected marine groups were the brachiopods, trilobites, ammonites, and acritarchs , and the world saw the disappearance of an estimated 96% of vertebrates like conodonts and bony fishes , and all of the ostracoderms and placoderms. [ 67 ] [ 70 ] Land plants as well as freshwater species, such as our tetrapod ancestors, were relatively unaffected by the Late Devonian extinction event (there is a counterargument that the Devonian extinctions nearly wiped out the tetrapods [ 71 ] ). 

The reasons for the Late Devonian extinctions are still unknown, and all explanations remain speculative. [ 72 ] [ 73 ] [ 74 ] [ 75 ] Canadian paleontologist Digby McLaren suggested in 1969 that the Devonian extinction events were caused by an asteroid impact. However, while there were Late Devonian collision events (see the Alamo bolide impact ), little evidence supports the existence of a large enough Devonian crater. [ 76 ]

- ^ Sedgwick and Murchison coined the term "Devonian system" in 1840: [ 16 ] "We propose therefore, for the future, to designate these groups collectively by the name Devonian system ". Sedgwick and Murchison acknowledged William Lonsdale's role in proposing, on the basis of fossil evidence, the existence of a Devonian stratum between those of the Silurian and Carboniferous periods: [ 17 ] "Again, Mr. Lonsdale, after an extensive examination of the fossils of South Devon, had pronounced them, more than a year since, to form a group intermediate between those of the Carboniferous and Silurian systems ".

William Lonsdale stated that in December 1837 he had suggested the existence of a stratum between the Silurian and Carboniferous ones: [ 18 ] "Mr. Austen's communication [was] read December 1837 ... . It was immediately after the reading of that paper ... that I formed the opinion relative to the limestones of Devonshire being of the age of the old red sandstone; and which I afterwards suggested first to Mr. Murchison and then to Prof. Sedgwick".

Integrative and Comparative Biology . 47 (4): 510– 523. doi : 10.1093/icb/icm055 . PMID 21672860 . Estimates of oxygen levels during this period suggest that they were unprecedentedly low during the Givetian and Frasnian periods. At the same time, plant diversification was at its most rapid, changing the character of the landscape and contributing, via soils, soluble nutrients, and decaying plant matter, to anoxia in all water systems. The co-occurrence of these global events may explain the evolution of air-breathing adaptations in at least two lobe-finned groups, contributing directly to the rise of the tetrapod stem group.

The Carboniferous ( / ˌ k ɑːr b ə ˈ n ɪ f ər ə s / KAR -bə- NIF -ər-əs ) [ 6 ] is a geologic period and system of the Paleozoic era that spans 60 million years, from the end of the Devonian Period 358.86 Ma (million years ago) to the beginning of the Permian Period, 298.9 Ma. It is the fifth period of the Phanerozoic eon . In North America , the Carboniferous is often treated as two separate geological periods, the earlier Mississippian and the later Pennsylvanian . [ 7 ] 

The name Carboniferous means " coal -bearing", from the Latin carbō (" coal ") and ferō ("bear, carry"), and refers to the many coal beds formed globally during that time. [ 8 ] The first of the modern "system" names, it was coined by geologists William Conybeare and William Phillips in 1822, [ 9 ] based on a study of the British rock succession. 

The Carboniferous is the period during which both terrestrial animal and land plant life was well established. [ 10 ] Stegocephalia (four-limbed vertebrates including true tetrapods ), whose forerunners ( tetrapodomorphs ) had evolved from lobe-finned fish during the preceding Devonian period, became pentadactylous during the Carboniferous. [ 11 ] The period is sometimes called the Age of Amphibians [ 12 ] because of the diversification of early amphibians such as the temnospondyls , which became dominant land vertebrates, [ 13 ] as well as the first appearance of amniotes including synapsids (the clade to which modern mammals belong) and sauropsids (which include modern reptiles and birds) during the late Carboniferous. Land arthropods such as arachnids (e.g. trigonotarbids and Pulmonoscorpius ), myriapods (e.g. Arthropleura ) and especially insects (particularly flying insects ) also underwent a major evolutionary radiation during the late Carboniferous. Vast swaths of forests and swamps covered the land, which eventually became the coal beds characteristic of the Carboniferous stratigraphy evident today. 

The later half of the period experienced glaciations , low sea level, and mountain building as the continents collided to form Pangaea . A minor marine and terrestrial extinction event, the Carboniferous rainforest collapse , occurred at the end of the period, caused by climate change. [ 14 ] Atmospheric oxygen levels, originally thought to be consistently higher than today throughout the Carboniferous, have been shown to be more variable, increasing from low levels at the beginning of the Period to highs of 25–30%. [ 15 ] 

# Etymology and history 
[ edit ] 

The development of a Carboniferous chronostratigraphic timescale began in the late 18th century. The term "Carboniferous" was first used as an adjective by Irish geologist Richard Kirwan in 1799 and later used in a heading entitled "Coal-measures or Carboniferous Strata" by John Farey Sr. in 1811. Four units were originally ascribed to the Carboniferous, in ascending order, the Old Red Sandstone , Carboniferous Limestone , Millstone Grit and the Coal Measures . These four units were placed into a formalised Carboniferous unit by William Conybeare and William Phillips in 1822 and then into the Carboniferous System by Phillips in 1835. The Old Red Sandstone was later considered Devonian in age. [ 16 ] 

The similarity in successions between the British Isles and Western Europe led to the development of a common European timescale with the Carboniferous System divided into the lower Dinantian , dominated by carbonate deposition and the upper Silesian with mainly siliciclastic deposition. [ 17 ] The Dinantian was divided into the Tournaisian and Viséan stages. The Silesian was divided into the Namurian , Westphalian and Stephanian stages. The Tournaisian is the same length as the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) stage, but the Viséan is longer, extending into the lower Serpukhovian . [ 16 ] 

North American geologists recognised a similar stratigraphy but divided it into two systems rather than one. These are the lower carbonate-rich sequence of the Mississippian System and the upper siliciclastic and coal-rich sequence of the Pennsylvanian . The United States Geological Survey officially recognised these two systems in 1953. [ 18 ] In Russia, in the 1840s British and Russian geologists divided the Carboniferous into the Lower, Middle and Upper series based on Russian sequences. In the 1890s these became the Dinantian, Moscovian and Uralian stages. The Serpukivian was proposed as part of the Lower Carboniferous, and the Upper Carboniferous was divided into the Moscovian and Gzhelian . The Bashkirian was added in 1934. [ 16 ] 

In 1975, the ICS formally ratified the Carboniferous System, with the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian subsystems from the North American timescale, the Tournaisian and Visean stages from the Western European and the Serpukhovian, Bashkirian, Moscovian, Kasimovian and Gzhelian from the Russian. [ 16 ] With the formal ratification of the Carboniferous System, the Dinantian, Silesian, Namurian, Westphalian and Stephanian became redundant terms, although the latter three are still in common use in Western Europe. [ 17 ]

# Stratigraphy 
[ edit ] 

Stages can be defined globally or regionally. For global stratigraphic correlation, the ICS ratify global stages based on a Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) from a single formation (a stratotype ) identifying the lower boundary of the stage. Only the boundaries of the Carboniferous System and three of the stage bases are defined by global stratotype sections and points because of the complexity of the geology. [ 19 ] [ 16 ] The ICS subdivisions from youngest to oldest are as follows: [ 20 ] 
Series/epoch Stage/age Lower boundary Permian Asselian 298.9 ±0.15 Ma Pennsylvanian Upper Gzhelian 303.7 ±0.1 Ma Kasimovian 307.0 ±0.1 Ma Middle Moscovian 315.2 ±0.2 Ma Lower Bashkirian 323.2 ±0.4 Ma Mississippian Upper Serpukhovian 330.9 ±0.2 Ma Middle Visean 346.7 ±0.4 Ma Lower Tournaisian 358.9 ±0.4 Ma 

# Mississippian 
[ edit ] 

The Mississippian was proposed by Alexander Winchell in 1870 named after the extensive exposure of lower Carboniferous limestone in the upper Mississippi River valley. [ 18 ] During the Mississippian, there was a marine connection between the Paleo-Tethys and Panthalassa through the Rheic Ocean resulting in the near worldwide distribution of marine faunas and so allowing widespread correlations using marine biostratigraphy . [ 19 ] [ 16 ] However, there are few Mississippian volcanic rocks , and so obtaining radiometric dates is difficult. [ 19 ] 

The Tournaisian Stage is named after the Belgian city of Tournai . It was introduced in scientific literature by Belgian geologist André Dumont in 1832. The GSSP for the base of the Carboniferous System, Mississippian Subsystem and Tournaisian Stage is located at the La Serre section in Montagne Noire , southern France. It is defined by the first appearance of the conodont Siphonodella sulcata within the evolutionary lineage from Siphonodella praesulcata to Siphonodella sulcata . This was ratified by the ICS in 1990. However, in 2006 further study revealed the presence of Siphonodella sulcata below the boundary, and the presence of Siphonodella praesulcata and Siphonodella sulcata together above a local unconformity . This means the evolution of one species to the other, the definition of the boundary, is not seen at the La Serre site making precise correlation difficult. [ 16 ] [ 21 ] 
Chart of regional subdivisions of the Carboniferous Period 

The Viséan Stage was introduced by André Dumont in 1832 and is named after the city of Visé , Liège Province , Belgium. In 1967, the base of the Visean was officially defined as the first black limestone in the Leffe facies at the Bastion Section in the Dinant Basin . These changes are now thought to be ecologically driven rather than caused by evolutionary change, and so this has not been used as the location for the GSSP. Instead, the GSSP for the base of the Visean is located in Bed 83 of the sequence of dark grey limestones and shales at the Pengchong section, Guangxi , southern China. It is defined by the first appearance of the fusulinid Eoparastaffella simplex in the evolutionary lineage Eoparastaffella ovalis – Eoparastaffella simplex and was ratified in 2009. [ 16 ] 

The Serpukhovian Stage was proposed in 1890 by Russian stratigrapher Sergei Nikitin . It is named after the city of Serpukhov , near Moscow and currently lacks a defined GSSP. The Visean-Serpukhovian boundary coincides with a major period of glaciation. The resulting sea level fall and climatic changes led to the loss of connections between marine basins and endemism of marine fauna across the Russian margin. This means changes in biota are environmental rather than evolutionary making wider correlation difficult. [ 16 ] Work is underway in the Urals and Nashui, Guizhou Province, southwestern China for a suitable site for the GSSP with the proposed definition for the base of the Serpukhovian as the first appearance of conodont Lochriea ziegleri . [ 21 ] 

# Pennsylvanian 
[ edit ] 

The Pennsylvanian was proposed by J.J.Stevenson in 1888, named after the widespread coal-rich strata found across the state of Pennsylvania. [ 18 ] The closure of the Rheic Ocean and formation of Pangea during the Pennsylvanian, together with widespread glaciation across Gondwana led to major climate and sea level changes, which restricted marine fauna to particular geographic areas thereby reducing widespread biostratigraphic correlations. [ 19 ] [ 16 ] Extensive volcanic events associated with the assembling of Pangea means more radiometric dating is possible relative to the Mississippian. [ 19 ] 

The Bashkirian Stage was proposed by Russian stratigrapher Sofia Semikhatova in 1934. It was named after Bashkiria , the then Russian name of the republic of Bashkortostan in the southern Ural Mountains of Russia. The GSSP for the base of the Pennsylvanian Subsystem and Bashkirian Stage is located at Arrow Canyon in Nevada , US and was ratified in 1996. It is defined by the first appearance of the conodont Declinognathodus noduliferus . Arrow Canyon lay in a shallow, tropical seaway which stretched from Southern California to Alaska. The boundary is within a cyclothem sequence of transgressive limestones and fine sandstones , and regressive mudstones and brecciated limestones. [ 16 ] 

The Moscovian Stage is named after shallow marine limestones and colourful clays found around Moscow, Russia. It was first introduced by Sergei Nikitin in 1890. The Moscovian currently lacks a defined GSSP. The fusulinid Aljutovella aljutovica can be used to define the base of the Moscovian across the northern and eastern margins of Pangea, however, it is restricted in geographic area, which means it cannot be used for global correlations. [ 16 ] The first appearance of the conodonts Declinognathodus donetzianus or Idiognathoides postsulcatus have been proposed as a boundary marking species and potential sites in the Urals and Nashui, Guizhou Province, southwestern China are being considered. [ 21 ] 

The Kasimovian is the first stage in the Upper Pennsylvanian. It is named after the Russian city of Kasimov , and was originally included as part of Nikitin's 1890 definition of the Moscovian. It was first recognised as a distinct unit by A.P. Ivanov in 1926, who named it the " Tiguliferina " Horizon after a type of brachiopod . The boundary of the Kasimovian covers a period of globally low sea level, which has resulted in disconformities within many sequences of this age. This has created difficulties in finding suitable marine fauna that can used to correlate boundaries worldwide. [ 16 ] The Kasimovian currently lacks a defined GSSP; potential sites in the southern Urals, southwest USA and Nashui, Guizhou Province, southwestern China are being considered. [ 21 ] 

The Gzhelian is named after the Russian village of Gzhel (selo), Moscow Oblast , near Ramenskoye , not far from Moscow. The name and type locality were defined by Sergei Nikitin in 1890. The Gzhelian currently lacks a defined GSSP. The first appearance of the fusulinid Rauserites rossicus and Rauserites stuckenbergi can be used in the Boreal Sea and Paleo-Tethyan regions but not eastern Pangea or Panthalassa margins. [ 16 ] Potential sites in the Urals and Nashui, Guizhou Province, southwestern China for the GSSP are being considered. [ 21 ] 

The GSSP for the base of the Permian is located in the Aidaralash River valley near Aqtöbe , Kazakhstan and was ratified in 1996. The beginning of the stage is defined by the first appearance of the conodont Streptognathodus postfusus . [ 22 ] 

# Cyclothems 
[ edit ] 

A cyclothem is a succession of non-marine and marine sedimentary rocks , deposited during a single sedimentary cycle, with an erosional surface at its base. Whilst individual cyclothems are often only metres to a few tens of metres thick, cyclothem sequences can be many hundreds to thousands of metres thick and contain tens to hundreds of individual cyclothems. [ 23 ] Cyclothems were deposited along continental shelves where the very gentle gradient of the shelves meant even small changes in sea level led to large advances or retreats of the sea. [ 18 ] Cyclothem lithologies vary from mudrock and carbonate-dominated to coarse siliciclastic sediment-dominated sequences depending on the paleo-topography, climate and supply of sediments to the shelf. [ 24 ] 
Cliff section through the Serpukhovian Red Wharf Limestone Formation, Wales . A marine limestone at the base of the cliff is overlain by an orange-coloured fluvial sandstone. Subaerial exposure of the limestone during a period of falling sea level resulted in the formation of a karstic surface, which has then been infilled by the river sands. A thin, estuarine silty mudstone overlays the sandstone, which in turn is overlain by a second marine limestone. 

The main period of cyclothem deposition occurred during the Late Paleozoic Ice Age from the Late Mississippian to early Permian, when the waxing and waning of ice sheets led to rapid changes in eustatic sea level . [ 24 ] The growth of ice sheets led global sea levels to fall as water was locked away in glaciers. Falling sea levels exposed large tracts of the continental shelves across which river systems eroded channels and valleys and vegetation broke down the surface to form soils . The non-marine sediments deposited on this erosional surface form the base of the cyclothem. [ 24 ] As sea levels began to rise, the rivers flowed through increasingly water-logged landscapes of swamps and lakes. Peat mires developed in these wet and oxygen-poor conditions, leading to coal formation. [ 17 ] With continuing sea level rise, coastlines migrated landward and deltas , lagoons and esturaries developed; their sediments deposited over the peat mires. As fully marine conditions were established, limestones succeeded these marginal marine deposits. The limestones were in turn overlain by deep water black shales as maximum sea levels were reached. [ 18 ] 

Ideally, this sequence would be reversed as sea levels began to fall again; however, sea level falls tend to be protracted, whilst sea level rises are rapid, ice sheets grow slowly but melt quickly. Therefore, the majority of a cyclothem sequence occurred during falling sea levels, when rates of erosion were high, meaning they were often periods of non-deposition. Erosion during sea level falls could also result in the full or partial removal of previous cyclothem sequences. Individual cyclothems are generally less than 10 m thick because the speed at which sea level rose gave only limited time for sediments to accumulate. [ 24 ] 

During the Pennsylvanian, cyclothems were deposited in shallow, epicontinental seas across the tropical regions of Laurussia (present day western and central US, Europe, Russia and central Asia) and the North and South China cratons . [ 18 ] The rapid sea levels fluctuations they represent correlate with the glacial cycles of the Late Paleozoic Ice Age. The advance and retreat of ice sheets across Gondwana followed a 100 kyr Milankovitch cycle , and so each cyclothem represents a cycle of sea level fall and rise over a 100 kyr period. [ 24 ] 

# Coal formation 
[ edit ] 
Hyden Formation over Pikeville Formation in the Pennsylvanian of Kentucky, US. The exposure has Pennsylvanian-aged cyclothemic sedimentary rocks of the Breathitt Group. The upper part of the roadcut is Hyden Formation, consisting of mixed siliciclastics and coal. The lower part is Pikeville Formation, also having mixed siliciclastics and coal. 

Coal forms when organic matter builds up in waterlogged, anoxic swamps, known as peat mires, and is then buried, compressing the peat into coal. The majority of Earth's coal deposits were formed during the late Carboniferous and early Permian. The plants from which they formed contributed to changes in the Carboniferous Earth's atmosphere. [ 25 ] 

During the Pennsylvanian, vast amounts of organic debris accumulated in the peat mires that formed across the low-lying, humid equatorial wetlands of the foreland basins of the Central Pangean Mountains in Laurussia, and around the margins of the North and South China cratons. [ 25 ] During glacial periods, low sea levels exposed large areas of the continental shelves. Major river channels, up to several kilometres wide, stretched across these shelves feeding a network of smaller channels, lakes and peat mires. [ 17 ] These wetlands were then buried by sediment as sea levels rose during interglacials . Continued crustal subsidence of the foreland basins and continental margins allowed this accumulation and burial of peat deposits to continue over millions of years resulting in the formation of thick and widespread coal formations. [ 25 ] During the warm interglacials, smaller coal swamps with plants adapted to the temperate conditions formed on the Siberian craton and the western Australian region of Gondwana. [ 18 ] 

There is ongoing debate as to why this peak in the formation of Earth's coal deposits occurred during the Carboniferous. The first theory, known as the delayed fungal evolution hypothesis, is that a delay between the development of trees with the wood fibre lignin and the subsequent evolution of lignin-degrading fungi gave a period of time where vast amounts of lignin-based organic material could accumulate. Genetic analysis of basidiomycete fungi, which have enzymes capable of breaking down lignin, supports this theory by suggesting this fungi evolved in the Permian. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] However, significant Mesozoic and Cenozoic coal deposits formed after lignin-digesting fungi had become well established, and fungal degradation of lignin may have already evolved by the end of the Devonian, even if the specific enzymes used by basidiomycetes had not. [ 25 ] The second theory is that the geographical setting and climate of the Carboniferous were unique in Earth's history: the co-occurrence of the position of the continents across the humid equatorial zone, high biological productivity, and the low-lying, water-logged and slowly subsiding sedimentary basins that allowed the thick accumulation of peat were sufficient to account for the peak in coal formation. [ 25 ] 

# Palaeogeography 
[ edit ] 

During the Carboniferous, there was an increased rate in tectonic plate movements as the supercontinent Pangea assembled. The continents themselves formed a near circle around the opening Paleo-Tethys Ocean, with the massive Panthalassic Ocean beyond. Gondwana covered the south polar region. To its northwest was Laurussia. These two continents slowly collided to form the core of Pangea. To the north of Laurussia lay Siberia and Amuria . To the east of Siberia, Kazakhstania , North China and South China formed the northern margin of the Paleo-Tethys, with Annamia laying to the south. [ 28 ]

# Variscan-Alleghanian-Ouachita orogeny 
[ edit ] 

The Central Pangean Mountains were formed during the Variscan - Alleghanian - Ouachita orogeny. Today their remains stretch over 10,000 km from the Gulf of Mexico in the west to Turkey in the east. [ 31 ] The orogeny was caused by a series of continental collisions between Laurussia, Gondwana and the Armorican terrane assemblage (much of modern-day Central and Western Europe including Iberia ) as the Rheic Ocean closed and Pangea formed. This mountain building process began in the Middle Devonian and continued into the early Permian. [ 29 ] 

The Armorican terranes rifted away from Gondwana during the Late Ordovician . As they drifted northwards the Rheic Ocean closed in front of them, and they began to collide with southeastern Laurussia in the Middle Devonian. [ 29 ] The resulting Variscan orogeny involved a complex series of oblique collisions with associated metamorphism , igneous activity, and large-scale deformation between these terranes and Laurussia, which continued into the Carboniferous. [ 29 ] 

During the mid Carboniferous, the South American sector of Gondwana collided obliquely with Laurussia's southern margin resulting in the Ouachita orogeny. [ 29 ] The major strike-slip faulting that occurred between Laurussia and Gondwana extended eastwards into the Appalachian Mountains where early deformation in the Alleghanian orogeny was predominantly strike-slip. As the West African sector of Gondwana collided with Laurussia during the Late Pennsylvanian, deformation along the Alleghanian orogen became northwesterly-directed compression . [ 28 ] [ 31 ] 

# Uralian orogeny 
[ edit ] 

The Uralian orogeny is a north–south trending fold and thrust belt that forms the western edge of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt . [ 32 ] The Uralian orogeny began in the Late Devonian and continued, with some hiatuses, into the Jurassic . From the Late Devonian to early Carboniferous, the Magnitogorsk island arc , which lay between Kazakhstania and Laurussia in the Ural Ocean , collided with the passive margin of northeastern Laurussia ( Baltica craton ). The suture zone between the former island arc complex and the continental margin formed the Main Uralian Fault , a major structure that runs for more than 2,000 km along the orogen. Accretion of the island arc was complete by the Tournaisian, but subduction of the Ural Ocean between Kazakhstania and Laurussia continued until the Bashkirian when the ocean finally closed and continental collision began. [ 32 ] Significant strike-slip movement along this zone indicates the collision was oblique. Deformation continued into the Permian and during the late Carboniferous and Permian the region was extensively intruded by granites . [ 29 ] [ 32 ] 

# Laurussia 
[ edit ] 

The Laurussian continent was formed by the collision between Laurentia , Baltica and Avalonia during the Devonian. At the beginning of the Carboniferous, some models show it at the equator, while others place it further south. In either case, the continent drifted northwards, reaching low latitudes in the northern hemisphere by the end of the Period. [ 28 ] [ 30 ] The Central Pangean Mountain drew in moist air from the Paleo-Tethys Ocean resulting in heavy precipitation and a tropical wetland environment. Extensive coal deposits developed within the cyclothem sequences that dominated the Pennsylvanian sedimentary basins associated with the growing orogenic belt. [ 18 ] [ 33 ] 

Subduction of the Panthalassic oceanic plate along its western margin resulted in the Antler orogeny in the Late Devonian to Early Mississippian. Further north along the margin, slab roll-back , beginning in the Early Mississippian, led to the rifting of the Yukon–Tanana terrane and the opening of the Slide Mountain Ocean . Along the northern margin of Laurussia, orogenic collapse of the Late Devonian to Early Mississippian Innuitian orogeny led to the development of the Sverdrup Basin . [ 29 ] 

# Gondwana 
[ edit ] 

Much of Gondwana lay in the southern polar region during the Carboniferous. As the plate moved, the South Pole drifted from southern Africa in the early Carboniferous to eastern Antarctica by the end of the period. [ 28 ] Glacial deposits are widespread across Gondwana and indicate multiple ice centres and long-distance movement of ice. [ 23 ] The northern to northeastern margin of Gondwana (northeast Africa, Arabia, India and northeastern West Australia) was a passive margin along the southern edge of the Paleo-Tethys with cyclothem deposition including, during more temperate intervals, coal swamps in Western Australia. [ 28 ] The Mexican terranes along the northwestern Gondwana margin, were affected by the subduction of the Rheic Ocean. [ 29 ] However, they lay to west of the Ouachita orogeny and were not impacted by continental collision but became part of the active margin of the Pacific. [ 31 ] The Moroccan margin was affected by periods of widespread dextral strike-slip deformation, magmatism and metamorphism associated with the Variscan orogeny. [ 28 ] 

Towards the end of the Carboniferous, extension and rifting across the northern margin of Gondwana led to the breaking away of the Cimmerian terrane during the early Permian and the opening of the Neo-Tethys Ocean . [ 29 ] Along the southeastern and southern margin of Gondwana (eastern Australia and Antarctica), northward subduction of Panthalassa continued. Changes in the relative motion of the plates resulted in the early Carboniferous Kanimblan Orogeny . Continental arc magmatism continued into the late Carboniferous and extended round to connect with the developing proto-Andean subduction zone along the western South American margin of Gondwana. [ 28 ] 

# Siberia and Amuria 
[ edit ] 

Shallow seas covered much of the Siberian craton in the early Carboniferous. These retreated as sea levels fell in the Pennsylvanian and as the continent drifted north into more temperate zones extensive coal deposits formed in the Kuznetsk Basin . [ 33 ] The northwest to eastern margins of Siberia were passive margins along the Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean on the far side of which lay Amuria. From the mid Carboniferous, subduction zones with associated magmatic arcs developed along both margins of the ocean. [ 29 ] 

The southwestern margin of Siberia was the site of a long lasting and complex accretionary orogen. The Devonian to early Carboniferous Siberian and South Chinese Altai accretionary complexes developed above an east-dipping subduction zone, whilst further south, the Zharma-Saur arc formed along the northeastern margin of Kazakhstania. [ 34 ] By the late Carboniferous, all these complexes had accreted to the Siberian craton as shown by the intrusion of post-orogenic granites across the region. As Kazakhstania had already accreted to Laurussia, Siberia was effectively part of Pangea by 310 Ma, although major strike-slip movements continued between it and Laurussia into the Permian. [ 29 ] 

# Central and East Asia 
[ edit ] 

The Kazakhstanian microcontinent is composed of a series of Devonian and older accretionary complexes. It was strongly deformed during the Carboniferous as its western margin collided with Laurussia during the Uralian orogen and its northeastern margin collided with Siberia. Continuing strike-slip motion between Laurussia and Siberia led the formerly elongate microcontinent to bend into an orocline . [ 29 ] 

During the Carboniferous, the Tarim craton lay along the northwestern edge of North China. Subduction along the Kazakhstanian margin of the Turkestan Ocean resulted in collision between northern Tarim and Kazakhstania during the mid Carboniferous as the ocean closed. The South Tian Shan fold and thrust belt , which extends over 2,000 km from Uzbekistan to northwest China, is the remains of this accretionary complex and forms the suture between Kazakhstania and Tarim. [ 29 ] [ 35 ] A continental magmatic arc above a south-dipping subduction zone lay along the northern North China margin, consuming the Paleoasian Ocean. [ 28 ] Northward subduction of the Paleo-Tethys beneath the southern margins of North China and Tarim continued during the Carboniferous, with the South Qinling block accreted to North China during the mid to late Carboniferous. [ 29 ] No sediments are preserved from the early Carboniferous in North China. However, bauxite deposits immediately above the regional mid Carboniferous unconformity indicate warm tropical conditions and are overlain by cyclothems including extensive coals. [ 28 ] 

South China and Annamia (Southeast Asia) rifted from Gondwana during the Devonian. [ 29 ] During the Carboniferous, they were separated from each other and North China by the Paleoasian Ocean with the Paleo-Tethys to the southwest and Panthalassa to the northeast. Cyclothem sediments with coal and evaporites were deposited across the passive margins that surrounded both continents. [ 28 ] 

# Climate 
[ edit ] 

The Carboniferous climate was dominated by the Late Paleozoic Ice Age (LPIA), the most extensive and longest icehouse period of the Phanerozoic, which lasted from the Late Devonian to the Permian (365 Ma-253 Ma). [ 36 ] [ 23 ] Temperatures began to drop during the late Devonian with a short-lived glaciation in the late Famennian through Devonian–Carboniferous boundary, [ 23 ] before the Early Tournaisian Warm Interval. [ 36 ] Following this, a reduction in atmospheric CO 2 levels, caused by the increased burial of organic matter and widespread ocean anoxia led to climate cooling and glaciation across the south polar region. [ 37 ] During the Visean Warm Interval glaciers nearly vanished retreating to the proto-Andes in Bolivia and western Argentina and the Pan-African mountain ranges in southeastern Brazil and southwest Africa. [ 36 ] 

The main phase of the LPIA (c. 335–290 Ma) began in the late Visean, as the climate cooled and atmospheric CO 2 levels dropped. Its onset was accompanied by a global fall in sea level and widespread multimillion-year unconformities. [ 23 ] This main phase consisted of a series of discrete several million-year-long glacial periods during which ice expanded out from up to 30 ice centres that stretched across mid- to high latitudes of Gondwana in eastern Australia, northwestern Argentina, southern Brazil, and central and Southern Africa. [ 23 ] 

Isotope records indicate this drop in CO 2 levels was triggered by tectonic factors with increased weathering of the growing Central Pangean Mountains and the influence of the mountains on precipitation and surface water flow. [ 37 ] Closure of the oceanic gateway between the Rheic and Tethys oceans in the early Bashkirian also contributed to climate cooling by changing ocean circulation and heat flow patterns. [ 38 ] 

Warmer periods with reduced ice volume within the Bashkirian, the late Moscovian and the latest Kasimovian to mid-Gzhelian are inferred from the disappearance of glacial sediments, the appearance of deglaciation deposits and rises in sea levels. [ 23 ] 

In the early Kasimovian there was short-lived (<1 million years) intense period of glaciation, with atmospheric CO 2 concentration levels dropping as low as 180 ppm. [ 39 ] This ended suddenly as a rapid increase in CO 2 concentrations to c. 600 ppm resulted in a warmer climate. This rapid rise in CO 2 may have been due to a peak in pyroclastic volcanism and/or a reduction in burial of terrestrial organic matter. [ 39 ] 

The LPIA peaked across the Carboniferous-Permian boundary. Widespread glacial deposits are found across South America, western and central Africa, Antarctica, Australia, Tasmania, the Arabian Peninsula, India, and the Cimmerian blocks, indicating trans-continental ice sheets across southern Gondwana that reached to sea-level. [ 23 ] In response to the uplift and erosion of the more mafic basement rocks of the Central Pangea Mountains at this time, CO 2 levels dropped as low as 175 ppm and remained under 400 ppm for 10 Ma. [ 39 ] 

# Temperatures 
[ edit ] 

Temperatures across the Carboniferous reflect the phases of the LPIA. At the extremes, during the Permo-Carboniferous Glacial Maximum (299–293 Ma) the global average temperature (GAT) was c. 13 °C (55 °F), the average temperature in the tropics c. 24 °C (75 °F) and in polar regions c. -23 °C (-10 °F), whilst during the Early Tournaisian Warm Interval (358–353 Ma) the GAT was c. 22 °C (72 °F), the tropics c. 30 °C (86 °F) and polar regions c. 1.5 °C (35 °F). Overall, for the Ice Age the GAT was c. 17 °C (62 °F), with tropical temperatures c. 26 °C and polar temperatures c. -9.0 °C (16 °F). [ 36 ] 

# Atmospheric oxygen levels 
[ edit ] 

There are a variety of methods for reconstructing past atmospheric oxygen levels, including the charcoal record, halite gas inclusions, burial rates of organic carbon and pyrite , carbon isotopes of organic material, isotope mass balance and forward modelling. [ 40 ] Depending on the preservation of source material, some techniques represent moments in time (e.g. halite gas inclusions), [ 41 ] whilst others have a wider time range (e.g. the charcoal record and pyrite). [ 42 ] [ 15 ] Results from these different methods for the Carboniferous vary. [ 40 ] For example: the increasing occurrence of charcoal produced by wildfires from the Late Devonian into the Carboniferous indicates increasing oxygen levels, with calculations showing oxygen levels above 21% for most of the Carboniferous; [ 42 ] halite gas inclusions from sediments dated 337–335 Ma give estimates for the Visean of c. 15.3%, although with large uncertainties; [ 41 ] [ 40 ] and, pyrite records suggest levels of c. 15% early in the Carboniferous, to over 25% during the Pennsylvanian, before dropping back below 20% towards the end. [ 15 ] However, whilst exact numbers vary, all models show an overall increase in atmospheric oxygen levels from a low of between 15 and 20% at the beginning of the Carboniferous to highs of 25–30% during the Period. This was not a steady rise, but included peaks and troughs reflecting the dynamic climate conditions of the time. [ 40 ] [ 15 ] How the atmospheric oxygen concentrations influenced the large body size of arthropods and other fauna and flora during the Carboniferous is also a subject of ongoing debate. [ 43 ] 

# Effects of climate on sedimentation 
[ edit ] 

The changing climate was reflected in regional-scale changes in sedimentation patterns. In the relatively warm waters of the Early to Middle Mississippian, carbonate production occurred to depth across the gently dipping continental slopes of Laurussia and North and South China ( carbonate ramp architecture) [ 23 ] and evaporites formed around the coastal regions of Laurussia, Kazakhstania, and northern Gondwana. [ 18 ] 

From the late Visean, the cooling climate restricted carbonate production to depths of less than c. 10 m forming carbonate shelves with flat-tops and steep sides. By the Moscovian, the waxing and waning of the ice sheets led to cyclothem deposition with mixed carbonate-siliciclastic sequences deposited on continental platforms and shelves. [ 23 ] [ 36 ] 

Seasonal melting of glaciers resulted in near freezing waters around the margins of Gondwana. This is evidenced by the occurrence of glendonite (a pseudomorph of ikaite ; a form of calcite deposited in glacial waters) in fine-grained, shallow marine sediments. [ 36 ] 

The glacial grinding and erosion of siliciclastic rocks across Gondwana and the Central Pangaean Mountains produced vast amounts of silt-sized sediment. Redistributed by the wind, this formed widespread deposits of loess across equatorial Pangea. [ 44 ] 

# Effects of climate on biodiversity 
[ edit ] 

The main phase of the LPIA was considered a crisis for marine biodiversity with the loss of many genera, followed by low biodiversity. However, recent studies of marine life suggest the rapid climate and environmental changes that accompanied the onset of the main glacial phase resulted in an adaptive radiation with a rapid increase in the number of species. [ 23 ] 

The oscillating climate conditions also led to repeated restructuring of Laurasian tropical forests between wetlands and seasonally dry ecosystems, [ 38 ] and the appearance and diversification of tetrapods species. [ 45 ] There was a major restructuring of wetland forests during the Kasimovian glacial interval, with the loss of arborescent (tree-like) lycopisids and other wetland groups, and a general decline in biodiversity. These events are attributed to the drop in CO 2 levels below 400 ppm. [ 23 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] Although referred to as the Carboniferous rainforest collapse, this was a complex replacement of one type of rainforest by another, not a complete disappearance of rainforest vegetation. [ 45 ] 

Across the Carboniferous–Permian boundary interval, a rapid drop in CO 2 levels and increasingly arid conditions at low-latitudes led to a permanent shift to seasonally dry woodland vegetation. [ 38 ] [ 39 ] Tetrapods acquired new terrestrial adaptations and there was a radiation of dryland-adapted amniotes . [ 23 ] 

# Geochemistry 
[ edit ] 

As the continents assembled to form Pangea, the growth of the Central Pangean Mountains led to increased weathering and carbonate sedimentation on the ocean floor, [ 46 ] whilst the distribution of continents across the paleo-tropics meant vast areas of land were available for the spread of tropical rainforests. [ 18 ] Together these two factors significantly increased CO 2 drawdown from the atmosphere, lowering global temperatures, increasing ocean pH and triggering the Late Paleozoic Ice Age. [ 46 ] The growth of the supercontinent also changed seafloor spreading rates and led to a decrease in the length and volume of mid-ocean ridge systems. [ 18 ] 

# Magnesium/calcium isotope ratios in seawater 
[ edit ] 

During the early Carboniferous, the Mg 2+ /Ca 2+ ratio in seawater began to rise and by the Middle Mississippian aragonite seas had replaced calcite seas . [ 18 ] The concentration of calcium in seawater is largely controlled by ocean pH, and as this increased the calcium concentration was reduced. At the same time, the increase in weathering, increased the amount of magnesium entering the marine environment. As magnesium is removed from seawater and calcium added along mid-ocean ridges where seawater reacts with the newly formed lithosphere, the reduction in length of mid-ocean ridge systems increased the Mg 2+ /Ca 2+ ratio further. [ 18 ] The Mg 2+ /Ca 2+ ratio of the seas also affects the ability of organisms to biomineralize . The Carboniferous aragonite seas favoured those that secreted aragonite and the dominant reef builders of the time were aragonitic sponges and corals. [ 18 ] 

# Strontium isotopic composition of seawater 
[ edit ] 

The strontium isotopic composition ( 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) of seawater represents a mix of strontium derived from continental weathering which is rich in 87 Sr and from mantle sources e.g. mid-ocean ridges, which are relatively depleted in 87 Sr. 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios above 0.7075 indicate continental weathering is the main source of 87 Sr, whilst ratios below indicate mantle-derived sources are the principal contributor. [ 17 ] 

87 Sr/ 86 Sr values varied through the Carboniferous, although they remained above 0.775, indicating continental weathering dominated as the source of 87 Sr throughout. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr during the Tournaisian was c. 0.70840, it decreased through the Visean to 0.70771 before increasing during the Serpukhovian to the lowermost Gzhelian where it plateaued at 0.70827, before decreasing again to 0.70814 at the Carboniferous-Permian boundary. [ 37 ] These variations reflect the changing influence of weathering and sediment supply to the oceans of the growing Central Pangean Mountains. By the Serpukhovian basement rocks, such as granite , had been uplifted and exposed to weathering. The decline towards the end of the Carboniferous is interpreted as a decrease in continental weathering due to the more arid conditions. [ 47 ] 

# Oxygen and carbon isotope ratios in seawater 
[ edit ] 

Unlike Mg 2+ /Ca 2+ and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotope ratios, which are consistent across the world's oceans at any one time, δ 18 O and δ 13 C preserved in the fossil record can be affected by regional factors. [ 37 ] Carboniferous δ 18 O and δ 13 C records show regional differences between the South China open-water setting and the epicontinental seas of Laurussia. These differences are due to variations in seawater salinity and evaporation between epicontinental seas relative to the more open waters. [ 37 ] However, large scale trends can still be determined. δ 13 C rose rapidly from c. 0 to 1‰ (parts per thousand) to c. 5 to 7‰ in the Early Mississippian and remained high for the duration of the Late Paleozoic Ice Age (c. 3–6‰) into the early Permian. [ 37 ] Similarly from the Early Mississippian there was a long-term increase in δ 18 O values as the climate cooled. [ 23 ] 

Both δ 13 C and δ 18 O records show significant global isotope changes (known as excursions) during the Carboniferous. [ 37 ] The mid-Tournaisian positive δ 13 C and δ 18 O excursions lasted between 6 and 10 million years and were also accompanied by c. 6‰ positive excursion in organic matter δ 15 N values, [ 23 ] a negative excursion in carbonate δ 238 U and a positive excursion in carbonate-associated sulphate δ 34 S . [ 37 ] These changes in seawater geochemistry are interpreted as a decrease in atmospheric CO 2 due to increased organic matter burial and widespread ocean anoxia triggering climate cooling and onset of glaciation. [ 37 ] 

The Mississippian-Pennsylvanian boundary positive δ 18 O excursion occurred at the same time as global sea level falls and widespread glacial deposits across southern Gondwana, indicating climate cooling and ice build-up. The rise in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr just before the δ 18 O excursion suggests climate cooling in this case was caused by increased continental weathering of the growing Central Pangean Mountains and the influence of the orogeny on precipitation and surface water flow rather than increased burial of organic matter. δ 13 C values show more regional variation, and it is unclear whether there is a positive δ 13 C excursion or a readjustment from previous lower values. [ 37 ] 

During the early Kasimovian there was a short (<1myr), intense glacial period, which came to a sudden end as atmospheric CO 2 concentrations rapidly rose. [ 23 ] There was a steady increase in arid conditions across tropical regions and a major reduction in the extent of tropical rainforests, as shown by the widespread loss of coal deposits from this time. [ 47 ] The resulting reduction in productivity and burial of organic matter led to increasing atmospheric CO 2 levels, which were recorded by a negative δ 13 C excursion and an accompanying, but smaller decrease in δ 18 O values. [ 23 ]

# Plants 
[ edit ] 
Etching depicting some of the most significant plants of the Carboniferous 

Early Carboniferous land plants, some of which were preserved in coal balls , were very similar to those of the preceding Late Devonian, but new groups also appeared at this time. The main early Carboniferous plants were the Equisetales (horse-tails), Sphenophyllales (scrambling plants), Lycopodiales (club mosses), Lepidodendrales (scale trees), Filicales (ferns), Medullosales (informally included in the " seed ferns ", an assemblage of a number of early gymnosperm groups) and the Cordaitales . These continued to dominate throughout the period, but during the late Carboniferous, several other groups, Cycadophyta (cycads), the Callistophytales (another group of "seed ferns"), and the Voltziales , appeared.

The Carboniferous lycophytes of the order Lepidodendrales, which are cousins (but not ancestors) of the tiny club-moss of today, were huge trees with trunks 30 meters high and up to 1.5 meters in diameter. These included Lepidodendron (with its cone called Lepidostrobus ), Anabathra , Lepidophloios and Sigillaria . [ 48 ] The roots of several of these forms are known as Stigmaria . Unlike present-day trees, their secondary growth took place in the cortex , which also provided stability, instead of the xylem . [ 49 ] The Cladoxylopsids were large trees, that were ancestors of ferns, first arising in the Carboniferous. [ 50 ] 

Wikisource has the text of the 1879 American Cyclopædia article Coal Plants . 

The fronds of some Carboniferous ferns are almost identical with those of living species. Probably many species were epiphytic . Fossil ferns and "seed ferns" include Pecopteris , Cyclopteris , Neuropteris , Alethopteris , and Sphenopteris ; Megaphyton and Caulopteris were tree ferns. [ 48 ] 

The Equisetales included the common giant form Calamites , with a trunk diameter of 30 to 60 cm (24 in) and a height of up to 20 m (66 ft). Sphenophyllum was a slender climbing plant with whorls of leaves, which was probably related both to the calamites and the lycopods. [ 48 ] 

Cordaites , a tall plant (6 to over 30 meters) with strap-like leaves, was related to the cycads and conifers; the catkin -like reproductive organs, which bore ovules/seeds, is called Cardiocarpus . These plants were thought to live in swamps. True coniferous trees ( Walchia , of the order Voltziales) appear later in the Carboniferous, [ 48 ] and preferred higher drier ground. 

# Marine invertebrates 
[ edit ] 

In the oceans the marine invertebrate groups are the Foraminifera , corals , Bryozoa , Ostracoda , brachiopods , ammonoids , hederelloids , microconchids and echinoderms (especially crinoids ). [ citation needed ] The diversity of brachiopods and fusilinid foraminiferans, surged beginning in the Visean , continuing through the end of the Carboniferous, although cephalopod and nektonic conodont diversity declined. This evolutionary radiation was known as the Carboniferous-Earliest Permian Biodiversification Event. [ 51 ] For the first time foraminifera took a prominent part in the marine faunas. The large spindle-shaped genus Fusulina and its relatives were abundant in what is now Russia, China, Japan, North America; other important genera include Valvulina , Endothyra , Archaediscus , and Saccammina (the latter common in Britain and Belgium). Some Carboniferous genera are still extant . The first true priapulids appeared during this period. [ 48 ] 

The microscopic shells of radiolarians are found in cherts of this age in the Culm of Devon and Cornwall , and in Russia, Germany and elsewhere. Sponges are known from spicules and anchor ropes, [ 48 ] and include various forms such as the Calcispongea Cotyliscus and Girtycoelia , the demosponge Chaetetes , and the genus of unusual colonial glass sponges Titusvillia . Both reef -building and solitary corals diversify and flourish; these include both rugose (for example, Caninia , Corwenia , Neozaphrentis ), heterocorals, and tabulate (for example, Chladochonus , Michelinia ) forms. Conularids were well represented by Conularia 

Bryozoa are abundant in some regions; the fenestellids including Fenestella , Polypora , and Archimedes , so named because it is in the shape of an Archimedean screw . Brachiopods are also abundant; [ 52 ] they include productids , some of which reached very large for brachiopods size and had very thick shells (for example, the 30 cm (12 in)-wide Gigantoproductus [ 53 ] [ 54 ] ), while others like Chonetes were more conservative in form. Athyridids , spiriferids , rhynchonellids , and terebratulids are also very common. Inarticulate forms include Discina and Crania . Some species and genera had a very wide distribution with only minor variations. 

Annelids such as Serpulites are common fossils in some horizons. Among the mollusca, the bivalves continue to increase in numbers and importance. Typical genera include Aviculopecten , Posidonomya , Nucula , Carbonicola , Edmondia , and Modiola . Gastropods are also numerous, including the genera Murchisonia , Euomphalus , Naticopsis . [ 48 ] Nautiloid cephalopods are represented by tightly coiled nautilids , with straight-shelled and curved-shelled forms becoming increasingly rare. Goniatite ammonoids such as Aenigmatoceras are common. 

Trilobites are rarer than in previous periods, on a steady trend towards extinction, represented only by the proetid group. Ostracoda , a class of crustaceans , were abundant as representatives of the meiobenthos ; genera included Amphissites , Bairdia , Beyrichiopsis , Cavellina , Coryellina , Cribroconcha , Hollinella , Kirkbya , Knoxiella , and Libumella . Crinoids were highly numerous during the Carboniferous, though they suffered a gradual decline in diversity during the Middle Mississippian. [ 55 ] Dense submarine thickets of long-stemmed crinoids appear to have flourished in shallow seas, and their remains were consolidated into thick beds of rock. Prominent genera include Cyathocrinus , Woodocrinus , and Actinocrinus . Echinoids such as Archaeocidaris and Palaeechinus were also present. The blastoids , which included the Pentreinitidae and Codasteridae and superficially resembled crinoids in the possession of long stalks attached to the seabed, attain their maximum development at this time.

# Freshwater and lagoonal invertebrates 
[ edit ] 

Freshwater Carboniferous invertebrates include various bivalve molluscs that lived in brackish or fresh water, such as Anthraconaia , Naiadites , and Carbonicola ; diverse crustaceans such as Candona , Carbonita , Darwinula , Estheria , Acanthocaris , Dithyrocaris , and Anthrapalaemon . The eurypterids were also diverse, and are represented by such genera as Adelophthalmus , Megarachne (originally misinterpreted as a giant spider, hence its name) and the specialised very large Hibbertopterus . Many of these were amphibious. Frequently a temporary return of marine conditions resulted in marine or brackish water genera such as Lingula , Orbiculoidea , and Productus being found in the thin beds known as marine bands. 

- 

Megarachne was a large freshwater eurypterid from South America that was originally misidentified as a spider 

-

Due to its large and compact shell, Hibbertopterus was one of if not the heaviest eurypterid in the fossil record 

# Terrestrial invertebrates 
[ edit ] 

Fossil remains of air-breathing insects , [ 56 ] myriapods , and arachnids [ 57 ] are known from the Carboniferous. Their diversity when they do appear, however, shows that these arthropods were both well-developed and numerous. [ 58 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] Some arthropods grew to large sizes with the up to 2.6-meter-long (8.5 ft) millipede-like Arthropleura being the largest-known land invertebrate of all time. In the mid-Mississippian the oldest known winged insects appears, [ 61 ] followed by the huge predatory Protodonata (griffinflies), which includes Meganeura , a giant dragonfly -like insect and with a wingspan of ca. 75 cm (30 in)—the largest flying insect ever to roam the planet. Further groups are the Syntonopterodea (relatives of present-day mayflies ), the abundant and often large sap-sucking Palaeodictyopteroidea , the diverse herbivorous Protorthoptera , and numerous basal Dictyoptera (ancestors of cockroaches ). [ 56 ] 

Many insects have been obtained from the coalfields of Saarbrücken and Commentry , and from the hollow trunks of fossil trees in Nova Scotia. Some British coalfields have yielded good specimens: Archaeoptilus , from the Derbyshire coalfield, had a large wing with 4.3 cm (2 in) preserved part, and some specimens ( Brodia ) still exhibit traces of brilliant wing colors. In the Nova Scotian tree trunks land snails ( Archaeozonites , Dendropupa ) have been found. [ 62 ]

# Fish 
[ edit ] 

Many fish inhabited the Carboniferous seas; predominantly Elasmobranchs (sharks and their relatives). These included some, like Psammodus , with crushing pavement-like teeth adapted for grinding the shells of brachiopods, crustaceans, and other marine organisms. Other groups of elasmobranchs, like the ctenacanthiformes grew to large sizes, with some genera like Saivodus reaching around 6–9 meters (20–30 ft). [ 63 ] Other fish had piercing teeth, such as the Symmoriida ; some, the petalodonts , had peculiar cycloid cutting teeth. Most of the other cartilaginous fish were marine, but others like the Xenacanthida , and several genera like Bandringa invaded fresh waters of the coal swamps. [ 64 ] Among the bony fish , the Palaeonisciformes found in coastal waters also appear to have migrated to rivers. Sarcopterygian fish were also prominent, and one group, the Rhizodonts , reached very large size. 

Most species of Carboniferous marine fish have been described largely from teeth, fin spines and dermal ossicles, [ 48 ] with smaller freshwater fish preserved whole. Freshwater fish were abundant, and include the genera Ctenodus , Uronemus , Acanthodes , Cheirodus , and Gyracanthus . Chondrichthyes (especially holocephalans like the Stethacanthids ) underwent a major evolutionary radiation during the Carboniferous. [ 65 ] It is believed that this evolutionary radiation occurred because the decline of the placoderms at the end of the Devonian caused many environmental niches to become unoccupied and allowed new organisms to evolve and fill these niches. [ 65 ] As a result of the evolutionary radiation Carboniferous holocephalans assumed a wide variety of bizarre shapes including Stethacanthus which possessed a flat brush-like dorsal fin with a patch of denticles on its top. [ 65 ] Stethacanthus 's unusual fin may have been used in mating rituals. [ 65 ] 

Other groups like the eugeneodonts filled in the niches left by large predatory placoderms. These fish were unique as they only possessed one, at most two, rows of teeth in either their upper or lower jaws in the form of elaborate tooth whorls. [ 66 ] The first members of the helicoprionidae , a family eugeneodonts that were characterized by the presence of one circular tooth whorl in the lower jaw, appeared during the early Carboniferous. [ 67 ] Perhaps the most bizarre radiation of holocephalans at this time was that of the iniopterygiformes , an order of holocephalans that greatly resembled modern day flying fish that could have also "flown" in the water with their massive, elongated pectoral fins. They were further characterized by their large eye sockets, club-like structures on their tails, and spines on the tips of their fins.

# Tetrapods 
[ edit ] 

Carboniferous amphibians were diverse and common by the middle of the period, more so than they are today; some were as long as 6 meters, and those fully terrestrial as adults had scaly skin. [ 68 ] They included basal tetrapod groups classified in early books under the Labyrinthodontia . These had a long body, a head covered with bony plates, and generally weak or undeveloped limbs. [ 62 ] The largest were over 2 meters long. They were accompanied by an assemblage of smaller amphibians included under the Lepospondyli , often only about 15 cm (6 in) long. Some Carboniferous amphibians were aquatic and lived in rivers ( Loxomma , Eogyrinus , Proterogyrinus ); others may have been semi-aquatic ( Ophiderpeton , Amphibamus , Hyloplesion ) or terrestrial ( Dendrerpeton , Tuditanus , Anthracosaurus ). 

The Carboniferous rainforest collapse slowed the evolution of amphibians who could not survive as well in the cooler, drier conditions. Amniotes, however, prospered because of specific key adaptations. [ 14 ] One of the greatest evolutionary innovations of the Carboniferous was the amniote egg, which allowed the laying of eggs in a dry environment, as well as keratinized scales and claws, allowing for the further exploitation of the land by certain tetrapods . These included the earliest sauropsid reptiles ( Hylonomus ), and the earliest known synapsid ( Archaeothyris ). Synapsids quickly became huge and diversified in the Permian, only for their dominance to stop during the Mesozoic. Sauropsids (reptiles, and also, later, birds) also diversified but remained small until the Mesozoic, during which they dominated the land, as well as the water and sky, only for their dominance to stop during the Cenozoic. 

Reptiles underwent a major evolutionary radiation in response to the drier climate that preceded the rainforest collapse. [ 14 ] [ 69 ] By the end of the Carboniferous amniotes had already diversified into a number of groups, including several families of synapsid pelycosaurs , protorothyridids , captorhinids , saurians and araeoscelids .

# Fungi 
[ edit ] 

As plants and animals were growing in size and abundance in this time, land fungi diversified further. Marine fungi still occupied the oceans. All modern classes of fungi were present in the late Carboniferous. [ 70 ] 

# Extinction events 
[ edit ] 

# Romer's gap 
[ edit ] 

Main article: Romer's gap 

The first 15 million years of the Carboniferous had very limited terrestrial fossils. While it has long been debated whether the gap is a result of fossilisation or relates to an actual event, recent work indicates there was a drop in atmospheric oxygen levels, indicating some sort of ecological collapse . [ 71 ] The gap saw the demise of the Devonian fish-like ichthyostegalian labyrinthodonts and the rise of the more advanced temnospondylian and reptiliomorphan amphibians that so typify the Carboniferous terrestrial vertebrate fauna. 

# Carboniferous rainforest collapse 
[ edit ] 

Main article: Carboniferous rainforest collapse 

Before the end of the Carboniferous, an extinction event occurred. On land this event is referred to as the Carboniferous rainforest collapse. [ 14 ] Vast tropical rainforests collapsed suddenly as the climate changed from hot and humid to cool and arid. This was likely caused by intense glaciation and a drop in sea levels. [ 72 ] The new climatic conditions were not favorable to the growth of rainforest and the animals within them. Rainforests shrank into isolated islands, surrounded by seasonally dry habitats. Towering lycopsid forests with a heterogeneous mixture of vegetation were replaced by much less diverse tree fern dominated flora. 

Amphibians, the dominant vertebrates at the time, fared poorly through this event with large losses in biodiversity; reptiles continued to diversify through key adaptations that let them survive in the drier habitat, specifically the hard-shelled egg and scales, both of which retain water better than their amphibian counterparts. [ 14 ]

The Permian ( / ˈ p ɜːr m i . ə n / PUR -mee-ən ) [ 4 ] is a geologic period and stratigraphic system which spans 47 million years, from the end of the Carboniferous Period 298.9 Ma (million years ago) to the beginning of the Triassic Period 251.902 Ma. It is the sixth and last period of the Paleozoic Era; the following Triassic Period belongs to the Mesozoic Era. The concept of the Permian was introduced in 1841 by geologist Sir Roderick Murchison , who named it after the region of Perm in Russia . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] 

The Permian witnessed the diversification of the two groups of amniotes , the synapsids and the sauropsids ( reptiles ). The world at the time was dominated by the supercontinent Pangaea , which had formed due to the collision of Euramerica and Gondwana during the Carboniferous. Pangaea was surrounded by the superocean Panthalassa . The Carboniferous rainforest collapse left behind vast regions of desert within the continental interior. [ 10 ] Amniotes, which could better cope with these drier conditions, rose to dominance in place of their amphibian ancestors. 

Various authors have proposed at least three, [ 11 ] and possibly four major extinction events in the Permian, though the validity of some of these extinctions has been disputed. [ 12 ] The end of the Early Permian ( Cisuralian ) has a gap in the fossil record that may have constituted a major extinction , as most lineages of primitive " pelycosaur " synapsids becoming extinct, being replaced by more advanced therapsids . The end of the Capitanian Stage of the Permian was marked by the major Capitanian mass extinction event , [ 13 ] associated with the eruption of the Emeishan Traps . The Permian (along with the Paleozoic) ended with the Permian–Triassic extinction event (colloquially known as the Great Dying), the largest mass extinction in Earth's history (which is the last of the three or four crises that occurred in the Permian), in which nearly 81% of marine species and 70% of terrestrial species died out, associated with the eruption of the Siberian Traps . It took well into the Triassic for life to recover from this catastrophe; [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] on land, ecosystems took 30 million years to recover. [ 17 ] 

# Etymology and history 
[ edit ] 

Prior to the introduction of the term Permian , rocks of equivalent age in Germany had been named the Rotliegend and Zechstein , and in Great Britain as the New Red Sandstone . [ 18 ] 

The term Permian was introduced into geology in 1841 by Sir Roderick Impey Murchison , president of the Geological Society of London , after extensive Russian explorations undertaken with Édouard de Verneuil in the vicinity of the Ural Mountains in the years 1840 and 1841. Murchison identified "vast series of beds of marl , schist , limestone , sandstone and conglomerate" that succeeded Carboniferous strata in the region. [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Murchison, in collaboration with Russian geologists, [ 21 ] named the period after the surrounding Russian region of Perm, which takes its name from the medieval kingdom of Permia that occupied the same area hundreds of years prior, and which is now located in the Perm Krai administrative region. [ 22 ] Between 1853 and 1867, Jules Marcou recognised Permian strata in a large area of North America from the Mississippi River to the Colorado River and proposed the name Dyassic , from Dyas and Trias , though Murchison rejected this in 1871. [ 23 ] The Permian system was controversial for over a century after its original naming, with the United States Geological Survey until 1941 considering the Permian a subsystem of the Carboniferous equivalent to the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian . [ 18 ] 

# Geology 
[ edit ] 

The Permian Period is divided into three epochs , from oldest to youngest, the Cisuralian , Guadalupian , and Lopingian . Geologists divide the rocks of the Permian into a stratigraphic set of smaller units called stages , each formed during corresponding time intervals called ages. Stages can be defined globally or regionally. For global stratigraphic correlation, the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) ratify global stages based on a Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) from a single formation (a stratotype ) identifying the lower boundary of the stage. The ages of the Permian, from youngest to oldest, are: [ 24 ] 
Epoch Stage Lower boundary (Ma) Early Triassic Induan 251.902 ±0.024 Lopingian Changhsingian 254.14 ±0.07 Wuchiapingian 259.51 ±0.21 Guadalupian Capitanian 264.28 ±0.16 Wordian 266.9 ±0.4 Roadian 273.01 ±0.14 Cisuralian Kungurian 283.5 ±0.6 Artinskian 290.1 ±0.26 Sakmarian 293.52 ±0.17 Asselian 298.9 ±0.15 

For most of the 20th century, the Permian was divided into the Early and Late Permian, with the Kungurian being the last stage of the Early Permian. [ 25 ] Glenister and colleagues in 1992 proposed a tripartite scheme, advocating that the Roadian-Capitanian was distinct from the rest of the Late Permian, and should be regarded as a separate epoch. [ 26 ] The tripartite split was adopted after a formal proposal by Glenister et al. (1999). [ 27 ] 

Historically, most marine biostratigraphy of the Permian was based on ammonoids ; however, ammonoid localities are rare in Permian stratigraphic sections, and species characterise relatively long periods of time. All GSSPs for the Permian are based around the first appearance datum of specific species of conodont , an enigmatic group of jawless chordates with hard tooth-like oral elements. Conodonts are used as index fossils for most of the Palaeozoic and the Triassic. [ 28 ] 

# Cisuralian 
[ edit ] 

The Cisuralian Series is named after the strata exposed on the western slopes of the Ural Mountains in Russia and Kazakhstan. The name was proposed by J. B. Waterhouse in 1982 to comprise the Asselian, Sakmarian, and Artinskian stages. The Kungurian was later added to conform to the Russian "Lower Permian". Albert Auguste Cochon de Lapparent in 1900 had proposed the "Uralian Series", but the subsequent inconsistent usage of this term meant that it was later abandoned. [ 29 ] 

The Asselian was named by the Russian stratigrapher V.E. Ruzhenchev in 1954, after the Assel River in the southern Ural Mountains. The GSSP for the base of the Asselian is located in the Aidaralash River valley near Aqtöbe , Kazakhstan, which was ratified in 1996. The beginning of the stage is defined by the first appearance of Streptognathodus postfusus . [ 30 ] 

The Sakmarian is named in reference to the Sakmara River in the southern Urals, and was coined by Alexander Karpinsky in 1874. The GSSP for the base of the Sakmarian is located at the Usolka section in the southern Urals, which was ratified in 2018. The GSSP is defined by the first appearance of Sweetognathus binodosus . [ 31 ] 

The Artinskian was named after the city of Arti in Sverdlovsk Oblast , Russia. It was named by Karpinsky in 1874. The Artinskian currently lacks a defined GSSP. [ 24 ] The proposed definition for the base of the Artinskian is the first appearance of Sweetognathus aff. S. whitei. [ 28 ] 

The Kungurian takes its name after Kungur , a city in Perm Krai. The stage was introduced by Alexandr Antonovich Stukenberg in 1890. The Kungurian currently lacks a defined GSSP. [ 24 ] Recent proposals have suggested the appearance of Neostreptognathodus pnevi as the lower boundary. [ 28 ] 

# Guadalupian 
[ edit ] 

The Guadalupian Series is named after the Guadalupe Mountains in Texas and New Mexico, where extensive marine sequences of this age are exposed. It was named by George Herbert Girty in 1902. [ 32 ] 

The Roadian was named in 1968 in reference to the Road Canyon Member of the Word Formation in Texas. [ 32 ] The GSSP for the base of the Roadian is located 42.7m above the base of the Cutoff Formation in Stratotype Canyon, Guadalupe Mountains, Texas, and was ratified in 2001. The beginning of the stage is defined by the first appearance of Jinogondolella nankingensis . [ 28 ] 

The Wordian was named in reference to the Word Formation by Johan August Udden in 1916, Glenister and Furnish in 1961 was the first publication to use it as a chronostratigraphic term as a substage of the Guadalupian Stage. [ 32 ] The GSSP for the base of the Wordian is located in Guadalupe Pass, Texas, within the sediments of the Getaway Limestone Member of the Cherry Canyon Formation , which was ratified in 2001. The base of the Wordian is defined by the first appearance of the conodont Jinogondolella aserrata . [ 28 ] 

The Capitanian is named after the Capitan Reef in the Guadalupe Mountains of Texas, named by George Burr Richardson in 1904, and first used in a chronostratigraphic sense by Glenister and Furnish in 1961 as a substage of the Guadalupian Stage. [ 32 ] The Capitanian was ratified as an international stage by the ICS in 2001. The GSSP for the base of the Capitanian is located at Nipple Hill in the southeast Guadalupe Mountains of Texas, and was ratified in 2001, the beginning of the stage is defined by the first appearance of Jinogondolella postserrata . [ 28 ] 

# Lopingian 
[ edit ] 

The Lopingian was first introduced by Amadeus William Grabau in 1923 as the "Loping Series" after Leping , Jiangxi , China. Originally used as a lithostraphic unit, T.K. Huang in 1932 raised the Lopingian to a series, including all Permian deposits in South China that overlie the Maokou Limestone. In 1995, a vote by the Subcommission on Permian Stratigraphy of the ICS adopted the Lopingian as an international standard chronostratigraphic unit. [ 33 ] 

The Wuchiapinginan and Changhsingian were first introduced in 1962, by J. Z. Sheng as the "Wuchiaping Formation" and "Changhsing Formation" within the Lopingian series. The GSSP for the base of the Wuchiapingian is located at Penglaitan, Guangxi , China and was ratified in 2004. The boundary is defined by the first appearance of Clarkina postbitteri postbitteri [ 33 ] The Changhsingian was originally derived from the Changxing Limestone, a geological unit first named by the Grabau in 1923, ultimately deriving from Changxing County , Zhejiang .The GSSP for the base of the Changhsingian is located 88 cm above the base of the Changxing Limestone in the Meishan D section, Zhejiang, China and was ratified in 2005, the boundary is defined by the first appearance of Clarkina wangi . [ 34 ] 

The GSSP for the base of the Triassic is located at the base of Bed 27c at the Meishan D section, and was ratified in 2001. The GSSP is defined by the first appearance of the conodont Hindeodus parvus . [ 35 ] 

# Regional stages 
[ edit ] 

The Russian Tatarian Stage includes the Lopingian, Capitanian and part of the Wordian, while the underlying Kazanian includes the rest of the Wordian as well as the Roadian. [ 25 ] 

In North America, the Permian is divided into the Wolfcampian (which includes the Nealian and the Lenoxian stages); the Leonardian (Hessian and Cathedralian stages); the Guadalupian; and the Ochoan, corresponding to the Lopingian. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] 

The New Zealand geologic time scale divides the Permian into three epochs, Pre-Telfordian (undivided), D'Urville (divided into the Makarewan, Waiitian, and Puruhauan stages), and Aparima (Flettian, Barrettian, Mangapirian, and Telfordian stages). The Pre-Telfordian epoch corresponds approximately to the Asselian, Sakmarian, and Artinskian stages; the D'Urville epoch is roughly contemporary with the Kungurian stage and Guadalupian epoch; and the Aparima epoch is closely contemporary with the Lopingian epoch. [ 38 ] 

# Paleogeography 
[ edit ] 
Geography of the Permian world 

During the Permian, all the Earth 's major landmasses were collected into a single supercontinent known as Pangaea , with the microcontinental terranes of Cathaysia to the east. Pangaea straddled the equator and extended toward the poles, with a corresponding effect on ocean currents in the single great ocean (" Panthalassa ", the "universal sea"), and the Paleo-Tethys Ocean , a large ocean that existed between Asia and Gondwana. The Cimmeria continent rifted away from Gondwana and drifted north to Laurasia , causing the Paleo-Tethys Ocean to shrink. A new ocean was growing on its southern end, the Neotethys Ocean , an ocean that would dominate much of the Mesozoic Era. [ 39 ] A magmatic arc, containing Hainan on its southwesternmost end, began to form as Panthalassa subducted under the southeastern South China. [ 40 ] The Central Pangean Mountains , which began forming due to the collision of Laurasia and Gondwana during the Carboniferous, reached their maximum height during the early Permian around 295 Ma, comparable to the present Himalayas , but became heavily eroded as the Permian progressed. [ 41 ] The Kazakhstania block collided with Baltica during the Cisuralian, while the North China Craton , the South China Block and Indochina fused to each other and Pangea by the end of the Permian. [ 42 ] The Zechstein Sea , a hypersaline epicontinental sea , existed in what is now northwestern Europe. [ 43 ] 

Large continental landmass interiors experience climates with extreme variations of heat and cold (" continental climate ") and monsoon conditions with highly seasonal rainfall patterns. Deserts seem to have been widespread on Pangaea. [ 44 ] Such dry conditions favored gymnosperms , plants with seeds enclosed in a protective cover, over plants such as ferns that disperse spores in a wetter environment. The first modern trees ( conifers , ginkgos and cycads ) appeared in the Permian. 

Three general areas are especially noted for their extensive Permian deposits—the Ural Mountains (where Perm itself is located), China, and the southwest of North America, including the Texas red beds. The Permian Basin in the U.S. states of Texas and New Mexico is so named because it has one of the thickest deposits of Permian rocks in the world. [ 45 ] 

# Paleoceanography 
[ edit ] 

Sea levels dropped slightly during the earliest Permian (Asselian). The sea level was stable at several tens of metres above present during the Early Permian, but there was a sharp drop beginning during the Roadian, culminating in the lowest sea level of the entire Palaeozoic at around present sea level during the Wuchiapingian, followed by a slight rise during the Changhsingian. [ 46 ] 

# Climate 
[ edit ] 
Selwyn Rock, South Australia , an exhumed glacial pavement of Permian age 

The Permian was cool in comparison to most other geologic time periods, with modest pole to Equator temperature gradients. At the start of the Permian, the Earth was still in the Late Paleozoic icehouse (LPIA), which began in the latest Devonian and spanned the entire Carboniferous period, with its most intense phase occurring during the latter part of the Pennsylvanian epoch. [ 47 ] [ 48 ] A significant trend of increasing aridification can be observed over the course of the Cisuralian. [ 49 ] Early Permian aridification was most notable in Pangaean localities at near-equatorial latitudes. [ 50 ] Sea levels also rose notably in the Early Permian as the LPIA slowly waned. [ 51 ] [ 52 ] At the Carboniferous-Permian boundary, a warming event occurred. [ 53 ] In addition to becoming warmer, the climate became notably more arid at the end of the Carboniferous and beginning of the Permian. [ 54 ] [ 55 ] Nonetheless, temperatures continued to cool during most of the Asselian and Sakmarian, during which the LPIA peaked. [ 48 ] [ 47 ] By 287 Ma, temperatures warmed and the South Pole ice cap retreated in what was known as the Artinskian Warming Event (AWE), [ 56 ] though glaciers remained present in the uplands of eastern Australia, [ 47 ] [ 57 ] and perhaps also the mountainous regions of far northern Siberia. [ 58 ] Southern Africa also retained glaciers during the late Cisuralian in upland environments. [ 59 ] The AWE also witnessed aridification of a particularly great magnitude. [ 56 ] 

In the late Kungurian, cooling resumed, [ 60 ] resulting in a cool glacial interval that lasted into the early Capitanian, [ 61 ] though average temperatures were still much higher than during the beginning of the Cisuralian. [ 57 ] Another cool period began around the middle Capitanian. [ 61 ] This cool period, lasting for 3–4 Myr, was known as the Kamura Event. [ 62 ] It was interrupted by the Emeishan Thermal Excursion in the late part of the Capitanian, around 260 million years ago, corresponding to the eruption of the Emeishan Traps . [ 63 ] This interval of rapid climate change was responsible for the Capitanian mass extinction event. [ 13 ] 

During the early Wuchiapingian, following the emplacement of the Emeishan Traps, global temperatures declined as carbon dioxide was weathered out of the atmosphere by the large igneous province's emplaced basalts. [ 64 ] The late Wuchiapingian saw the finale of the Late Palaeozoic Ice Age, when the last Australian glaciers melted. [ 47 ] The end of the Permian is marked by a temperature excursion, much larger than the Emeishan Thermal Excursion, at the Permian-Triassic boundary, corresponding to the eruption of the Siberian Traps , which released more than 5 teratonnes of CO 2 , more than doubling the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. [ 48 ] A -2% δ 18 O excursion signifies the extreme magnitude of this climatic shift. [ 65 ] This extremely rapid interval of greenhouse gas release caused the Permian-Triassic mass extinction, [ 66 ] as well as ushering in an extreme hothouse that persisted for several million years into the next geologic epoch, the Triassic. [ 67 ] 

The Permian climate was also extremely seasonal and characterised by megamonsoons , [ 68 ] which produced high aridity and extreme seasonality in Pangaea's interiors. [ 69 ] Precipitation along the western margins of the Palaeo-Tethys Ocean was very high. [ 70 ] Evidence for the megamonsoon includes the presence of megamonsoonal rainforests in the Qiangtang Basin of Tibet, [ 71 ] enormous seasonal variation in sedimentation, bioturbation, and ichnofossil deposition recorded in sedimentary facies in the Sydney Basin , [ 72 ] and palaeoclimatic models of the Earth's climate based on the behaviour of modern weather patterns showing that such a megamonsoon would occur given the continental arrangement of the Permian. [ 73 ] The aforementioned increasing equatorial aridity was likely driven by the development and intensification of this Pangaean megamonsoon. [ 74 ] 

# Life 
[ edit ] 
Hercosestria cribrosa , a reef -forming productid brachiopod (Middle Permian, Glass Mountains, Texas) 

# Marine biota 
[ edit ] 

Permian marine deposits are rich in fossil mollusks , [ 75 ] brachiopods , [ 76 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ] and echinoderms . [ 79 ] [ 80 ] Brachiopods were highly diverse during the Permian. The extinct order Productida was the predominant group of Permian brachiopods, accounting for up to about half of all Permian brachiopod genera. [ 81 ] Brachiopods also served as important ecosystem engineers in Permian reef complexes. [ 82 ] Amongst ammonoids , Goniatitida were a major group during the Early-Mid Permian, but declined during the Late Permian. Members of the order Prolecanitida were less diverse. The Ceratitida originated from the family Daraelitidae within Prolecanitida during the mid-Permian, and extensively diversified during the Late Permian. [ 83 ] Only three families of trilobite are known from the Permian, Proetidae , Brachymetopidae and Phillipsiidae . Diversity, origination and extinction rates during the Early Permian were low. Trilobites underwent a diversification during the Kungurian-Wordian, the last in their evolutionary history, before declining during the Late Permian. By the Changhsingian, only a handful (4–6) genera remained. [ 84 ] Corals exhibited a decline in diversity over the course of the Middle and Late Permian. [ 85 ] 

# Terrestrial biota 
[ edit ] 

Terrestrial life in the Permian included diverse plants, fungi , arthropods , and various types of tetrapods . The period saw a massive desert covering the interior of Pangaea . The warm zone spread in the northern hemisphere, where extensive dry desert appeared. [ 86 ] The rocks formed at that time were stained red by iron oxides, the result of intense heating by the sun of a surface devoid of vegetation cover. A number of older types of plants and animals died out or became marginal elements. 

The Permian began with the Carboniferous flora still flourishing. About the middle of the Permian a major transition in vegetation began. The swamp -loving lycopod trees of the Carboniferous, such as Lepidodendron and Sigillaria , were progressively replaced in the continental interior by the more advanced seed ferns and early conifers as a result of the Carboniferous rainforest collapse . At the close of the Permian, lycopod and equisete swamps reminiscent of Carboniferous flora survived only in Cathaysia , a series of equatorial islands in the Paleo-Tethys Ocean that later would become South China . [ 87 ] 

The Permian saw the radiation of many important conifer groups, including the ancestors of many present-day families. Rich forests were present in many areas, with a diverse mix of plant groups. The southern continent saw extensive seed fern forests of the Glossopteris flora. Oxygen levels were probably high there. The ginkgos and cycads also appeared during this period. 

# Insects 
[ edit ] 
Fossil and life restoration of Permocupes sojanensis , a permocupedid beetle from the Middle Permian of Russia 

Insects, which had first appeared and become abundant during the preceding Carboniferous, experienced a dramatic increase in diversification during the Early Permian. Towards the end of the Permian, there was a substantial drop in both origination and extinction rates. [ 88 ] By the start of the Permian, there was already an active coevolutionary arms race between insects and plant reproductive structures, evidenced by both insect-caused damage in plants and defensive structures in plants aimed at minimising predation by insects. [ 89 ] The dominant insects during the Permian Period were early representatives of Paleoptera , Polyneoptera , and Paraneoptera . Palaeodictyopteroidea , which had represented the dominant group of insects during the Carboniferous, declined during the Permian. This is likely due to competition by Hemiptera , due to their similar mouthparts and therefore ecology. Primitive relatives of damselflies and dragonflies ( Meganisoptera ), which include the largest flying insects of all time, also declined during the Permian. [ 90 ] Holometabola , the largest group of modern insects, also diversified during this time. [ 88 ] " Grylloblattidans ", an extinct group of winged insects thought to be related to modern ice crawlers , reached their apex of diversity during the Permian, representing up to a third of all insects at some localities. [ 91 ] Mecoptera (sometimes known as scorpionflies) first appeared during the Early Permian, going on to become diverse during the Late Permian. Some Permian mecopterans, like Mesopsychidae have long proboscis that suggest they may have pollinated gymnosperms. [ 92 ] The earliest known beetles appeared at the beginning of the Permian. Early beetles such as members of Permocupedidae were likely xylophagous , feeding on decaying wood. Several lineages such as Schizophoridae expanded into aquatic habitats by the Late Permian. [ 93 ] Members of the modern orders Archostemata and Adephaga are known from the Late Permian. [ 94 ] [ 95 ] Complex wood boring traces found in the Late Permian of China suggest that members of Polyphaga , the most diverse group of modern beetles, were also present by the Late Permian. [ 96 ] 

# Tetrapods 
[ edit ] 
Restoration of Weigeltisaurus jaekeli , a weigeltisaurid from the Late Permian of Europe. Weigeltisaurids represent the oldest known gliding vertebrates. 

The terrestrial fossil record of the Permian is patchy and temporally discontinuous. Early Permian records are dominated by equatorial Europe and North America, while those of the Middle and Late Permian are dominated by temperate Karoo Supergroup sediments of South Africa and the Ural region of European Russia. [ 97 ] Early Permian terrestrial faunas of North America and Europe were dominated by primitive pelycosaur synapsids including the herbivorous edaphosaurids , and carnivorous sphenacodontids , diadectids and amphibians . [ 98 ] [ 99 ] Early Permian reptiles, such as acleistorhinids , were mostly small insectivores. [ 100 ] 

# Amniotes 
[ edit ] 

Synapsids (the group that would later include mammals) thrived and diversified greatly during the Cisuralian. Permian synapsids included some large members such as Dimetrodon . The special adaptations of synapsids enabled them to flourish in the drier climate of the Permian and they grew to dominate the vertebrates. [ 98 ] A faunal turnover occurred around the transition between the Cisuralian and Guadalupian, with the decline of amphibians and the replacement of pelycosaurs (a paraphyletic group) with more advanced therapsids , [ 11 ] although the decline of early synapsid clades was apparently a slow event that lasted about 20 Ma, from the Sakmarian to the end of the Kungurian . [ 101 ] Predator-prey interactions among terrestrial synapsids became more dynamic. [ 102 ] If terrestrial deposition ended around the end of the Cisuralian in North America and began in Russia during the early Guadalupian, a continuous record of the transition is not preserved. Uncertain dating has led to suggestions that there is a global hiatus in the terrestrial fossil record during the late Kungurian and early Roadian , referred to as "Olson's Gap" that obscures the nature of the transition. Other proposals have suggested that the North American and Russian records overlap, [ 103 ] [ 104 ] [ 105 ] [ 106 ] with the latest terrestrial North American deposition occurring during the Roadian, suggesting that there was an extinction event, dubbed " Olson's Extinction ". [ 107 ] 

The Middle Permian faunas of South Africa and Russia are dominated by therapsids, most abundantly by the diverse Dinocephalia . Dinocephalians become extinct at the end of the Middle Permian, during the Capitanian mass extinction event . Late Permian faunas are dominated by advanced therapsids such as the predatory sabertoothed gorgonopsians and herbivorous beaked dicynodonts , alongside large herbivorous pareiasaur parareptiles . [ 108 ] The Archosauromorpha , the group of reptiles that would give rise to the pseudosuchians , dinosaurs , and pterosaurs in the following Triassic, first appeared and diversified during the Late Permian, including the first appearance of the Archosauriformes during the latest Permian. [ 109 ] Cynodonts , the group of therapsids ancestral to modern mammals , first appeared and gained a worldwide distribution during the Late Permian. [ 110 ] Another group of therapsids, the therocephalians (such as Lycosuchus ), arose in the Middle Permian. [ 111 ] [ 112 ] There were no flying vertebrates, though the extinct lizard-like reptile family Weigeltisauridae from the Late Permian had extendable wings like modern gliding lizards , and are the oldest known gliding vertebrates.

# Amphibians 
[ edit ] 

Permian stem-amniotes consisted of lepospondyli and batrachosaurs , according to some phylogenies; [ 115 ] according to others, stem-amniotes are represented only by diadectomorphs . [ 116 ] 

Temnospondyls reached a peak of diversity in the Cisuralian, with a substantial decline during the Guadalupian-Lopingian following Olson's extinction, with the family diversity dropping below Carboniferous levels. [ 117 ] 

Embolomeres , a group of aquatic crocodile-like limbed vertebrates that are reptilliomorphs under some phylogenies. They previously had their last records in the Cisuralian, are now known to have persisted into the Lopingian in China. [ 118 ] 

Modern amphibians ( lissamphibians ) are suggested to have originated during Permian, descending from a lineage of dissorophoid temnospondyls [ 119 ] or lepospondyls . [ 116 ] 

# Fish 
[ edit ] 

The diversity of fish during the Permian is relatively low compared to the following Triassic. The dominant group of bony fishes during the Permian were the " Paleopterygii " a paraphyletic grouping of Actinopterygii that lie outside of Neopterygii . [ 120 ] The earliest unequivocal members of Neopterygii appear during the Early Triassic, but a Permian origin is suspected. [ 121 ] The diversity of coelacanths is relatively low throughout the Permian in comparison to other marine fishes, though there is an increase in diversity during the terminal Permian (Changhsingian), corresponding with the highest diversity in their evolutionary history during the Early Triassic. [ 120 ] Diversity of freshwater fish faunas was generally low and dominated by lungfish and "Paleopterygians". [ 120 ] The last common ancestor of all living lungfish is thought to have existed during the Early Permian. Though the fossil record is fragmentary, lungfish appear to have undergone an evolutionary diversification and size increase in freshwater habitats during the Early Permian, but subsequently declined during the middle and late Permian. [ 122 ] Conodonts experienced their lowest diversity of their entire evolutionary history during the Permian. [ 123 ] Permian chondrichthyan faunas are poorly known. [ 124 ] Members of the chondrichthyan clade Holocephali , which contains living chimaeras , reached their apex of diversity during the Carboniferous-Permian, the most famous Permian representative being the "buzz-saw shark" Helicoprion , known for its unusual spiral shaped spiral tooth whorl in the lower jaw. [ 125 ] Hybodonts , a group of shark-like chondrichthyans, were widespread and abundant members of marine and freshwater faunas throughout the Permian. [ 124 ] [ 126 ] Xenacanthiformes , another extinct group of shark-like chondrichthyans, were common in freshwater habitats, and represented the apex predators of freshwater ecosystems. [ 127 ]

Map of the world at the Carboniferous-Permian boundary, showing the four floristic provinces 

Four floristic provinces in the Permian are recognised, the Angaran , Euramerican, Gondwanan, and Cathaysian realms. [ 128 ] The Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse would result in the replacement of lycopsid -dominated forests with tree-fern dominated ones during the late Carboniferous in Euramerica, and result in the differentiation of the Cathaysian floras from those of Euramerica. [ 128 ] The Gondwanan floristic region was dominated by Glossopteridales , a group of woody gymnosperm plants, for most of the Permian, extending to high southern latitudes. The ecology of the most prominent glossopterid, Glossopteris , has been compared to that of bald cypress , living in mires with waterlogged soils. [ 129 ] The tree-like calamites , distant relatives of modern horsetails , lived in coal swamps and grew in bamboo -like vertical thickets. A mostly complete specimen of Arthropitys from the Early Permian Chemnitz petrified forest of Germany demonstrates that they had complex branching patterns similar to modern angiosperm trees. [ 130 ] By the Late Permian, high thin forests had become widespread across the globe, as evidenced by the global distribution of weigeltisaurids. [ 131 ]

The oldest likely record of Ginkgoales (the group containing Ginkgo and its close relatives) is Trichopitys heteromorpha from the earliest Permian of France. [ 132 ] The oldest known fossils definitively assignable to modern cycads are known from the Late Permian. [ 133 ] In Cathaysia, where a wet tropical frost-free climate prevailed, the Noeggerathiales , an extinct group of tree fern-like progymnosperms were a common component of the flora [ 134 ] [ 135 ] The earliest Permian (~ 298 million years ago) Cathyasian Wuda Tuff flora, representing a coal swamp community, has an upper canopy consisting of lycopsid tree Sigillaria , with a lower canopy consisting of Marattialean tree ferns, and Noeggerathiales. [ 128 ] Early conifers appeared in the Late Carboniferous, represented by primitive walchian conifers, but were replaced with more derived voltzialeans during the Permian. Permian conifers were very similar morphologically to their modern counterparts, and were adapted to stressed dry or seasonally dry climatic conditions. [ 130 ] The increasing aridity, especially at low latitudes, facilitated the spread of conifers and their increasing prevalence throughout terrestrial ecosystems. [ 136 ] Bennettitales , which would go on to become in widespread the Mesozoic, first appeared during the Cisuralian in China. [ 137 ] Lyginopterids , which had declined in the late Pennsylvanian and subsequently have a patchy fossil record, survived into the Late Permian in Cathaysia and equatorial east Gondwana. [ 138 ] 

# Permian–Triassic extinction event 
[ edit ] 

Main article: Permian–Triassic extinction event 
The Permian–Triassic extinction event, labeled "End P" here, is the most significant extinction event in this plot for marine genera which produce large numbers of fossils 

The Permian ended with the most extensive extinction event recorded in paleontology : the Permian–Triassic extinction event . 90 to 95% of marine species became extinct , as well as 70% of all land organisms. It is also the only known mass extinction of insects. [ 16 ] [ 139 ] Recovery from the Permian–Triassic extinction event was protracted; on land, ecosystems took 30 million years to recover. [ 17 ] Trilobites , which had thrived since Cambrian times, finally became extinct before the end of the Permian. Nautiloids , a subclass of cephalopods, surprisingly survived this occurrence. 

There is evidence that magma , in the form of flood basalt , poured onto the Earth's surface in what is now called the Siberian Traps , for thousands of years, contributing to the environmental stress that led to mass extinction. The reduced coastal habitat and highly increased aridity probably also contributed. Based on the amount of lava estimated to have been produced during this period, the worst-case scenario is the release of enough carbon dioxide from the eruptions to raise world temperatures five degrees Celsius. [ 140 ] 

Another hypothesis involves ocean venting of hydrogen sulfide gas. Portions of the deep ocean will periodically lose all of its dissolved oxygen allowing bacteria that live without oxygen to flourish and produce hydrogen sulfide gas. If enough hydrogen sulfide accumulates in an anoxic zone , the gas can rise into the atmosphere. Oxidizing gases in the atmosphere would destroy the toxic gas, but the hydrogen sulfide would soon consume all of the atmospheric gas available. Hydrogen sulfide levels might have increased dramatically over a few hundred years. Models of such an event indicate that the gas would destroy ozone in the upper atmosphere allowing ultraviolet radiation to kill off species that had survived the toxic gas. [ 141 ] There are species that can metabolize hydrogen sulfide. 

Another hypothesis builds on the flood basalt eruption theory. An increase in temperature of five degrees Celsius would not be enough to explain the death of 95% of life. But such warming could slowly raise ocean temperatures until frozen methane reservoirs below the ocean floor near coastlines melted, expelling enough methane (among the most potent greenhouse gases ) into the atmosphere to raise world temperatures an additional five degrees Celsius. The frozen methane hypothesis helps explain the increase in carbon-12 levels found midway in the Permian–Triassic boundary layer. It also helps explain why the first phase of the layer's extinctions was land-based, the second was marine-based (and starting right after the increase in C-12 levels), and the third land-based again.

They do so, not merely because a portion of deposits has long been known by the name "grits of Perm", but because, being enormously developed in the governments of Perm and Orenburg, they there assume a  great variety of lithological features ...

For these reasons, then, we were led to abandon both the German and British nomenclature, and to prefer a geographical name, taken from the region in which the beds are loaded with fossils of an independent and intermediary character; and where the order of superposition is clear, the lower strata of the group being seen to rest upon the Carboniferous rocks.

The Triassic ( / t r aɪ ˈ æ s ɪ k / ; sometimes symbolized as 🝈 ) is a geologic period and a stratigraphic system that spans 50.5 million years from the end of the Permian Period 251.902 Ma (million years ago) to the beginning of the Jurassic Period 201.4 Ma. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] The Triassic Period is the first and shortest geologic period of the Mesozoic Era , and the seventh period of the Phanerozoic Eon . The start and the end of the Triassic Period featured major extinction events . [ 10 ] 

Chronologically, the Triassic Period is divided into three epochs: (i) the Early Triassic , (ii) the Middle Triassic , and (iii) the Late Triassic . The Triassic Period began after the Permian–Triassic extinction event that much reduced the biosphere of planet Earth. The fossil record of the Triassic Period presents three categories of organisms: (i) animals that survived the Permian–Triassic extinction event, (ii) new animals that briefly flourished in the Triassic biosphere, and (iii) new animals that evolved and dominated the Mesozoic Era. Reptiles , especially archosaurs , were the chief terrestrial vertebrates during this time. A specialized group of archosaurs, called dinosaurs , first appeared in the Late Triassic but did not become dominant until the succeeding Jurassic Period. [ 11 ] Archosaurs that became dominant in this period were primarily pseudosuchians , relatives and ancestors of modern crocodilians , while some archosaurs specialized in flight, the first time among vertebrates, becoming the pterosaurs . Therapsids , the dominant vertebrates of the preceding Permian period, saw a brief surge in diversification in the Triassic, with dicynodonts and cynodonts quickly becoming dominant, but they declined throughout the period with the majority becoming extinct by the end. However, the first stem-group mammals ( mammaliamorphs ), themselves a specialized subgroup of cynodonts, appeared during the Triassic and would survive the extinction event, allowing them to radiate during the Jurassic. Amphibians were primarily represented by the temnospondyls , giant aquatic predators that had survived the end-Permian extinction and saw a new burst of diversification in the Triassic, before going extinct by the end; however, early crown-group lissamphibians (including stem-group frogs , salamanders and caecilians ) also became more common during the Triassic and survived the extinction event. The earliest known neopterygian fish, including early holosteans and teleosts , appeared near the beginning of the Triassic, and quickly diversified to become among the dominant groups of fish in both freshwater and marine habitats. 

The vast supercontinent of Pangaea dominated the globe during the Triassic, but in the latest Triassic ( Rhaetian ) and Early Jurassic it began to gradually rift into two separate landmasses: Laurasia to the north and Gondwana to the south. The global climate during the Triassic was mostly hot and dry, [ 12 ] with deserts spanning much of Pangaea's interior. However, the climate shifted and became more humid as Pangaea began to drift apart. The end of the period was marked by yet another major mass extinction, the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event , that wiped out many groups, including most pseudosuchians, and allowed dinosaurs to assume dominance in the Jurassic. 

# Etymology 
[ edit ] 

The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich August von Alberti , after a succession of three distinct rock layers (Greek triás meaning 'triad') that are widespread in southern Germany : the lower Buntsandstein (colourful sandstone ) , the middle Muschelkalk (shell-bearing limestone ) and the upper Keuper (coloured clay ).

# Dating and subdivisions 
[ edit ] 

On the geologic time scale , the Triassic is usually divided into Early , Middle , and Late Triassic Epochs , and the corresponding rocks are referred to as Lower, Middle, or Upper Triassic. The faunal stages from the youngest to oldest are: 
Series/Epoch Faunal stage Time span Upper/Late Triassic (Tr3) Rhaetian (205.7   – 201.4 ± 0.2  Ma) Norian (227.3   – 205.7   Ma) Carnian (237   – 227.3   Ma) Middle Triassic (Tr2) Ladinian (241.464 ± 0.28  – 237   Ma) Anisian (246.7   – 241.464 ± 0.28  Ma) Lower/Early Triassic (Scythian) Olenekian (249.9   – 246.7   Ma) Induan (251.902 ± 0.024  – 249.9   Ma)

At the beginning of the Triassic, all the major continents were amalgamated into the supercontinent of Pangea. Centred on the equator, this stretched in an arc from the north to south polar regions with Laurussia in the north and Gondwana in the south. The Paleo - and Neo-Tethys oceans lay within the arc of the supercontinent with the vast Panthalassa Ocean beyond. [ 14 ] North China and Amuria , and South China were separated from Pangea by the Paleoasian Ocean, but this closed by the Late Triassic. [ 15 ] 

Pangea was surrounded by subduction zones that dipped beneath the supercontinent. The great mountain ranges that marked the Late Paleozoic continental collisions were largely eroded and were being replaced by regions of thinned crust that lay along the lines of the future Atlantic , Indian and Southern oceans. [ 14 ] [ 16 ] 

The supercontinent changed motion from drifting westward to rotating counterclockwise during late Permian. This continued until the Carnian (c. 230 Ma), after which it resumed the westward motion. These changes in motion were triggered by the opening of the Neo-Tethys, and closing of the Paleo-Tethys respectively, and affected tectonic regimes particularly along the southern and western margins. [ 17 ] 

The narrow Cimmerian terranes that had rifted from the northern margin of Gondwana in the Permian continued to drift northwards; the Paleo-Tethys Ocean closing in front of them and the Neo-Tethys opening behind. [ 15 ] 

Eruptions of the Siberian Traps Large Igneous Province (LIP) persisted into the Early Triassic [ 14 ] and the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) were active by the Late Triassic as a prelude to seafloor spreading in the Central Atlantic at the boundary of the Triassic and Jurassic. [ 18 ] 

# Northern Pangea (Laurussia) 
[ edit ] 

In northern-eastern Pangea, the Siberian Traps LIP continued to erupt into the Middle Triassic. Lower Triassic major deltaic systems (including the Triassic Boreal Ocean delta plain ) [ 19 ] advanced across the shallow Arctic Ocean . Their catchment areas the high ground of the Urals , Fennoscandinavia , the Canada-Greenland Shield and the Lomonosov High. [ 14 ] During the Late Triassic, in response to the opening of the Central Atlantic to the south, tectonic movements between North America and Baltica led to convergence in the High Arctic with uplift, folding and thrusting in the Barents Sea and North Siberian margin. [ 14 ] 

Major extensional tectonic movements, that began in the late Permian, continued across Laurussia from North/Central Europe in the east to eastern Canada in the west, with north-south trending graben systems developing across Europe, including further subsidence in the Northern and Southern Permian basins . [ 14 ] [ 16 ] Lower Triassic sediments deposited in these basins are continental to brackish marine in nature. They are overlain by shallow marine carbonates and mudstones and evaporites of the Zechstein Sea . [ 14 ] 

Further south, during the Norian, the opening of the Central Atlantic led to the formation of narrow, deep water basins in the Eastern Mediterranean area. [ 14 ] Corsica , Sardinia , Calabria , and the Balearic terranes were attached to Europe, whilst Apulia , Adria, and the terranes of southern Turkey remained attached to the African plate . [ 16 ] 

Along the western margin of Laurussia, a continental magmatic arc extended from the southwestern United States to the Arctic with an associated continental-scale foreland basin system. Localised back-arc basins developed within this, in regions of extension. [ 20 ] Along the northern section of the margin, the Permian to Early Triassic counterclockwise rotation of Pangea resulted in the closure of the narrow Slide Mountain Ocean and the Sonoma orogeny . [ 14 ] [ 21 ] In south, it led to a reduction in the dip of the subducting slab and thickening of the continental crust . [ 21 ] 

# Southern Pangea (Gondwana) 
[ edit ] 

Much of Africa was stable and above sea level, with only a few Triassic-aged lake sediments known, although along the northern coast marine sediments were deposited during periods of higher sea levels. [ 14 ] 

Northeast-southwest trending rifting along the eastern edge of Africa between Madagascar ( Indian plate ) and eastern Africa ( Somalian plate ) continued from the Late Carboniferous into the Triassic, with substantial mountains rising along the edge of the rift and the formation of a series of pull-apart basins . Gradual marine incursions from the Neo-Tethys resulted in the deposition of Lower and Middle Triassic marine sediments in these basins. Upper Triassic sediments are continental in nature and this rift system ultimately failed and a new north-south trending rift system developed in the Jurassic. [ 14 ] [ 22 ] 

The opening of the Neo-Tethys created passive margins along the Arabian and Indian margins. [ 14 ] [ 23 ] Rifting in the Neo-Tethys extended westwards between the Pontides and Taurides terranes of Turkey during the Late Triassic. [ 14 ] The Tethyan Himalayan block remained attached to India but was separated by the thinned crust of Greater India, the northern margin of which supplied sediments to the passive margin. [ 24 ] 

The counterclockwise rotation of Pangea precipitated dextral transpression across the NNE-SSW trending, west-dipping subduction zone, along the eastern Australian margin, which culminated in the Hunter-Bowen orogeny (c. 260-230 Ma). [ 17 ] [ 25 ] Following this, the magmatic arc rotated to north-south and compression gave way to extension. This was accompanied by subduction rollback and back-arc basin formation. [ 17 ] [ 25 ] 

Along the southwestern margin of South America , low plate convergence and subduction rates, triggered by the assembly and rotation of Pangea, resulted in subduction rollback and extension across the back-arc region. This generated large amounts of felsic magmatism . [ 26 ] [ 17 ] These extensional forces stretched across the continent with the formation of large northwest-trending basins with thick sedimentary deposits and the extension related magmatism. [ 14 ] 

# Closure of the Paleo-Tethys 
[ edit ] 

The Paleo-Tethys ocean formed as the continents surrounding it assembled to form Pangea in the Late Palaeozoic. [ 27 ] The Eurasian sector of Pangea lay along its north and northwestern margin. [ 14 ] To the northeast, the narrow Paleoasian Ocean (a branch of the Paleo-Tethys) lay between Eurasia, and North China and Tarim, and to the east, South China and Annamia (Southeast Asia). To the south were the Cimmerian terranes (Central Iran, Qiangtang (north Tibet), Lhasa (south Tibet), and Sibumasu (eastern Myanmar, Thailand, Malay peninsula and Sumatra). These terranes had rifted from northeastern Gondwana during the Permian. As they drifted northwards through the Triassic, the Paleo-Tethys closed in front of them, and the Neotethys opened behind. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] 

The Paleo-Tethys was being consumed by subduction zones along the southern margin of North China, much of the Eurasian margin, and along the northern margin of the Qiangtang-Annamia and Lhasa-Sibumasu blocks. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] 

Collisions between Annamia and South China (c. 246-230 Ma); between Sibumasu and South China–Annamia (c. 240-230 Ma); and, between Qiangtang and Lhasa (c. 250–230 Ma) resulted in the Indosinian orogeny and the formation of a single large Eastern Asian continent. [ 15 ] At about the same time (c. 240-230 Ma), the final closure of the Paleoasian Ocean led to the collision of Tarim and North China with the Kazakhstan and Siberian regions of Pangea, to form the Central Asian orogenic belt . [ 15 ] South China collided with North China (c. 220 Ma), forming the Central China orogenic belt. [ 15 ] The segment of the Paleo-Tethys between North China and Qiangtang may never have fully closed, but was filled with Permo-Triassic turbidites preserved in the West Kunlun and Bayanhar belts of the Central China orogenic belt. [ 28 ] 

The amalgamation of these East Asian blocks with Pangea in the Late Triassic maximised the land area of the supercontinent. It coincided with a period of dramatic climate change and the development of the megamonsoon, although the relationship between these is the subject of ongoing research. [ 15 ] 

The western Paleo-Tethys remained open until about 205 Ma, when the Iranian blocks collided with the Turan platform, on the southern margin of Eurasia, resulting in the Cimmerian orogeny. This extended from the Anatolian Plateau in the northwest, and merged with the Indosinian orogenic belt in the east. [ 14 ] [ 29 ] Late Triassic deformation across the Eastern Mediterranean area and much of the Middle East was complex, with regional scale strike-slip faulting and continued subduction below the Iranian margin. [ 14 ] 

# Opening of the Central Atlantic 
[ edit ] 

Beginning in the latest Permian, a broad zone of lithospheric extension developed across Pangea along the line of the future Central Atlantic Ocean. [ 18 ] [ 30 ] The location of this rifting followed the pre-existing structures of the Variscan orogeny , and began immediately after the orogenic collapse of the Variscan belt. [ 18 ] [ 22 ] Extension began in the northern Central Atlantic region in the Anisian, and in the southern Central Atlantic in the Carnian. [ 18 ] [ 30 ] 

Major rift basins formed along the present-day eastern North American margin from Florida to Newfoundland ( Newark Supergroup basins), and along the Europe/African margin (Moroccan and Iberian basins). The Moroccan basins are the equivalent of Nova Scotian basins, and the Iberian the equivalent of the Newfoundland basins. [ 30 ] These basins formed broad depressions on the continental crust that extended for hundreds of kilometres across central Pangea, with localised faulting formed sub-basins. [ 22 ] The basins were filled by mainly continental deposits from regional-scale river systems and lakes, with only minor, late marine incursions in some areas. [ 30 ] [ 22 ] 

The period of rifting came to an end with the emplacement of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) around 201 Ma. This was followed by seafloor spreading and the opening of the Central Atlantic Ocean. [ 18 ] The CAMP is one of the largest LIPs and covered a region of about 10 million km 2 across North America, northeastern South America, northwestern Africa, and southwestern Europe. [ 14 ] [ 18 ] The magmatism produced dense dyke swarms , with individual dykes up to 800 km long, massive sill complexes , and lava fields that covered several hundred kilometres. [ 31 ] Despite its size, the period of magmatism was brief, lasting only about 1 million years. Such intense igneous activity indicates widespread mantle melting, rather than a simple plume within the mantle. The varied petrological composition of the CAMP magmatism reflects local contamination of the upper mantle by continental lithosphere, including partial melting of previously subducted slabs. [ 18 ] [ 31 ] The magmatism, with its large scale injection of carbon and sulphur into the atmosphere, precipitated volcanic winters . This was followed by longer-term climate warming and ocean acidification , which caused  the end-Triassic mass extinction. [ 18 ] [ 32 ] [ 31 ] 

# Panthalassic Ocean 
[ edit ] 

Although no direct evidence remains, Panthalassa is thought to have been divided into three major tectonic plates: the Farallon ; Izanagi ; and, Phoenix . These were separated by oceanic spreading ridges. In the northeast, the smaller Cache Creek plate was being subducted beneath the western margin of North America, and beneath the Farallon plate to the south. [ 14 ]

# Paleooceanography 
[ edit ] 

Eustatic sea level in the Triassic was consistently low compared to the other geological periods. The beginning of the Triassic was around present sea level, rising to about 10–20 metres (33–66 ft) above present-day sea level during the Early and Middle Triassic. Sea level rise accelerated in the Ladinian, culminating with a sea level up to 50 metres (164 ft) above present-day levels during the Carnian. Sea level began to decline in the Norian, reaching a low of 50 metres (164 ft) below present sea level during the mid-Rhaetian. Low global sea levels persisted into the earliest Jurassic. The long-term sea level trend is superimposed by 22 sea level drop events widespread in the geologic record, mostly of minor (less than 25-metre (82 ft)) and medium (25–75-metre (82–246 ft)) magnitudes. A lack of evidence for Triassic continental ice sheets suggest that glacial eustasy is unlikely to be the cause of these changes. [ 34 ] It has generally been assumed that the cause was changes in volume of the global ocean basin due to variations in oceanic volcanism, with largest volumes occurring in volcanism's absence when the ocean basins were subsiding. [ 35 ] Variation in water and sediment delivery to the oceans, with higher sea levels during pluvial eras lasting up to four million years, is also hypothesised to be behind these sea level variations. [ 34 ] 

# Climate 
[ edit ] 

The Triassic continental interior climate was generally hot and dry, so that typical deposits are red bed sandstones and evaporites . There is no evidence of glaciation at or near either pole; in fact, the polar regions were apparently moist and temperate , providing a climate suitable for forests and vertebrates, including reptiles. Pangaea's large size limited the moderating effect of the global ocean; its continental climate was highly seasonal, with very hot summers and cool winters. [ 36 ] The strong contrast between the Pangea supercontinent and the global ocean triggered intense cross-equatorial monsoons , [ 36 ] sometimes referred to as the Pangean megamonsoons . [ 37 ] 

The Triassic may have mostly been a dry period, but evidence exists that it was punctuated by several episodes of increased rainfall in tropical and subtropical latitudes of the Tethys Sea and its surrounding land. [ 38 ] Sediments and fossils suggestive of a more humid climate are known from the Anisian to Ladinian of the Tethysian domain, and from the Carnian and Rhaetian of a larger area that includes also the Boreal domain (e.g., Svalbard Islands), the North American continent, the South China block and Argentina . The best-studied of such episodes of humid climate, and probably the most intense and widespread, was the Carnian Pluvial Event . 

# Early Triassic 
[ edit ] 

The Early Triassic was the hottest portion of the entire Phanerozoic, seeing as it occurred during and immediately after the discharge of titanic volumes of greenhouse gases from the Siberian Traps. The Early Triassic began with the Permian -Triassic Thermal Maximum (PTTM) and was followed by the brief Dienerian Cooling (DC) from 251 to 249 Ma, which was in turn followed by the Latest Smithian Thermal Maximum (LSTT) around 249 to 248 Ma. During the Latest Olenekian Cooling (LOC), from 248 to 247 Ma, temperatures cooled by about 6 °C. [ 39 ] 

# Middle Triassic 
[ edit ] 

The Middle Triassic was cooler than the Early Triassic, with temperatures falling over most of the Anisian, with the exception of a warming spike in the latter portion of the stage. [ 40 ] From 242 to 233 Ma, the Ladinian-Carnian Cooling (LCC) ensued. [ 39 ] 

# Late Triassic 
[ edit ] 

At the beginning of the Carnian, global temperatures continued to be relatively cool. [ 41 ] The eruption of the Wrangellia Large Igneous Province around 234 Ma caused abrupt global warming, terminating the cooling trend of the LCC. [ 42 ] This warming was responsible for the Carnian Pluvial Event and resulted in an episode of widespread global humidity. [ 43 ] The CPE ushered in the Mid-Carnian Warm Interval (MCWI), which lasted from 234 to 227 Ma. [ 39 ] At the Carnian-Norian boundary occurred a positive δ 13 C excursion believed to signify an increase in organic carbon burial. [ 44 ] From 227 to 217 Ma, there was a relatively cool period known as the Early Norian Cool Interval (ENCI), after which occurred the Mid-Norian Warm Interval (MNWI) from 217 to 209 Ma. The MNWI was briefly interrupted around 214 Ma by a cooling possibly related to the Manicouagan impact . [ 39 ] Around 212 Ma, a 10 Myr eccentricity maximum caused a paludification of Pangaea and a reduction in the size of arid climatic zones. [ 45 ] The Rhaetian Cool Interval (RCI) lasted from 209 to 201 Ma. [ 39 ] At the terminus of the Triassic, there was an extreme warming event referred to as the End-Triassic Thermal Event (ETTE), which was responsible for the Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction. [ 39 ] Bubbles of carbon dioxide in basaltic rocks dating back to the end of the Triassic indicate that volcanic activity from the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province helped trigger climate change in the ETTE. [ 46 ] 

# Flora 
[ edit ] 
Triassic flora as depicted in Meyers Konversations-Lexikon (1885–90) 

# Land plants 
[ edit ] 

During the Early Triassic, lycophytes , particularly those of the order Isoetales (which contains living quillworts ), rose to prominence due to the environmental instability following the Permian-Triassic extinction, with one particularly notable example being the genus Pleuromeia , which grew in columnar like fashion, sometimes reaching a height of 2 metres (6.6 ft). The relevance of lycophytes declined from the Middle Triassic onwards, following the return of more stable environmental conditions. [ 47 ] 

While having first appeared during the Permian, the extinct seed plant group Bennettitales first became a prominent element in global floras during the Late Triassic, a position they would hold for much of the Mesozoic. [ 48 ] In the Southern Hemisphere landmasses of Gondwana, the tree Dicroidium , an extinct " seed fern " belong to the order Corystospermales was a dominant element in forest habitats across the region during the Middle-Late Triassic. [ 49 ] During the Late Triassic, the Ginkgoales (which today are represented by only a single species, Ginkgo biloba ) underwent considerable diversification. [ 50 ] Conifers were abundant during the Triassic, and included the Voltziales (which contains various lineages, probably including those ancestral to modern conifers), [ 51 ] as well as the extinct family Cheirolepidiaceae , which first appeared in the Late Triassic, and would be prominent throughout most of the rest of the Mesozoic. [ 52 ] 

# Coal 
[ edit ] 
Immediately above the Permian–Triassic boundary the glossopteris flora was suddenly [ 53 ] largely displaced by an Australia -wide coniferous flora. 

No known coal deposits date from the start of the Triassic Period. This is known as the Early Triassic "coal gap" and can be seen as part of the Permian–Triassic extinction event . [ 54 ] Possible explanations for the coal gap include sharp drops in sea level at the time of the Permo-Triassic boundary; [ 55 ] acid rain from the Siberian Traps eruptions or from an impact event that overwhelmed acidic swamps; climate shift to a greenhouse climate that was too hot and dry for peat accumulation; evolution of fungi or herbivores that were more destructive of wetlands; the extinction of all plants adapted to peat swamps, with a hiatus of several million years before new plant species evolved that were adapted to peat swamps; [ 54 ] or soil anoxia as oxygen levels plummeted. [ 56 ] 

# Phytoplankton 
[ edit ] 

Before the Permian extinction, Archaeplastida (red and green algae) had been the major marine phytoplanktons since about 659–645 million years ago, [ 57 ] when they replaced marine planktonic cyanobacteria , which first appeared about 800 million years ago, as the dominant phytoplankton in the oceans. [ 58 ] In the Triassic, secondary endosymbiotic algae became the most important plankton. [ 59 ] 

# Fauna 
[ edit ]

# Marine invertebrates 
[ edit ] 

In marine environments , new modern types of corals appeared in the Early Triassic, forming small patches of reefs of modest extent compared to the great reef systems of Devonian or modern times. At the end of the Carnian, a reef crisis occurred in South China. [ 60 ] Serpulids appeared in the Middle Triassic. [ 61 ] Microconchids were abundant. The shelled cephalopods called ammonites recovered, diversifying from a single line that survived the Permian extinction. Bivalves began to rapidly diversify during the Middle Triassic, becoming highly abundant in the oceans. [ 62 ] 

# Insects 
[ edit ] 

Aquatic insects rapidly diversified during the Middle Triassic, with this time interval representing a crucial diversification for Holometabola , the clade containing the majority of modern insect species. [ 63 ] 

# Fish 
[ edit ] 
Birgeria 

In the wake of the Permian-Triassic mass extinction event , the fish fauna was remarkably uniform, with many families and genera exhibiting a cosmopolitan distribution . [ 64 ] Coelacanths show their highest post- Devonian diversity in the Early Triassic . [ 65 ] Ray-finned fishes (actinopterygians) went through a remarkable diversification in the beginning of the Triassic, leading to peak diversity during the Middle Triassic; however, the pattern of this diversification is still not well understood due to a taphonomic megabias . [ 66 ] The first stem-group teleosts appeared during the Triassic (teleosts are by far the most diverse group of fish today). [ 64 ] Predatory actinopterygians such as saurichthyids and birgeriids , some of which grew over 1.2 m (3.9 ft) in length, appeared in the Early Triassic and became widespread and successful during the period as a whole. [ 67 ] Lakes and rivers were populated by lungfish (Dipnoi), such as Ceratodus , which are mainly known from the dental plates, abundant in the fossils record. [ 68 ] Hybodonts , a group of shark-like cartilaginous fish , were dominant in both freshwater and marine environments throughout the Triassic. [ 69 ] Last survivors of the mainly Palaeozoic Eugeneodontida are known from the Early Triassic. [ 70 ] 

# Amphibians 
[ edit ] 
Reconstruction of the Triassic amphibian Mastodonsaurus 

Temnospondyl amphibians were among those groups that survived the Permian–Triassic extinction. Once abundant in both terrestrial and aquatic environments, the terrestrial species had mostly died out during the extinction event. The Triassic survivors were aquatic or semi-aquatic, and were represented by Tupilakosaurus , Thabanchuia , Branchiosauridae and Micropholis , all of which died out in Early Triassic, and the successful Stereospondyli , with survivors into the Cretaceous Period. The largest Triassic stereospondyls, such as Mastodonsaurus , were up to 4 to 6 metres (13 to 20 ft) in length. [ 71 ] [ 72 ] Some lineages (e.g. trematosaurs ) flourished briefly in the Early Triassic, while others (e.g. capitosaurs ) remained successful throughout the whole period, or only came to prominence in the Late Triassic (e.g. Plagiosaurus , metoposaurs ). 

The first Lissamphibians (modern amphibians) appear in the Triassic, with the progenitors of the first frogs already present by the Early Triassic. However, the group as a whole did not become common until the Jurassic , when the temnospondyls had become very rare. 

Most of the Reptiliomorpha , stem-amniotes that gave rise to the amniotes, disappeared in the Triassic, but two water-dwelling groups survived: Embolomeri that only survived into the early part of the period, and the Chroniosuchia , which survived until the end of the Triassic. 

The Ashfield Shale of western Sydney , formed during the Middle Triassic, features amphibian fossils from that period. [ 73 ] 

# Reptiles 
[ edit ] 

# Archosauromorphs 
[ edit ] 

The Permian–Triassic extinction devastated terrestrial life. Biodiversity rebounded as the surviving species repopulated empty terrain, but these were short-lived. Diverse communities with complex food-web structures took 30 million years to reestablish. [ 10 ] [ 74 ] Archosauromorph reptiles, which had already appeared and diversified to an extent in the Permian Period, exploded in diversity as an adaptive radiation in response to the Permian-Triassic mass extinction. By the Early Triassic, several major archosauromorph groups had appeared. Long-necked, lizard-like early archosauromorphs were known as protorosaurs , which is likely a paraphyletic group rather than a true clade. Tanystropheids were a family of protorosaurs which elevated their neck size to extremes, with the largest genus Tanystropheus having a neck longer than its body. The protorosaur family Sharovipterygidae used their elongated hindlimbs for gliding. Other archosauromorphs, such as rhynchosaurs and allokotosaurs , were mostly stocky-bodied herbivores with specialized jaw structures. 

Rhynchosaurs, barrel-gutted herbivores, thrived for only a short period of time, becoming extinct about 220 million years ago. They were exceptionally abundant in the middle of the Triassic, as the primary large herbivores in many Carnian-age ecosystems. They sheared plants with premaxillary beaks and plates along the upper jaw with multiple rows of teeth. Allokotosaurs were iguana-like reptiles, including Trilophosaurus (a common Late Triassic reptile with three-crowned teeth), Teraterpeton (which had a long beak-like snout), and Shringasaurus (a horned herbivore which reached a body length of 3–4 metres (9.8–13.1 ft)). 

One group of archosauromorphs, the archosauriforms , were distinguished by their active predatory lifestyle, with serrated teeth and upright limb postures. Archosauriforms were diverse in the Triassic, including various terrestrial and semiaquatic predators of all shapes and sizes. The large-headed and robust erythrosuchids were among the dominant carnivores in the early Triassic. Phytosaurs were a particularly common group which prospered during the Late Triassic. These long-snouted and semiaquatic predators resemble living crocodiles and probably had a similar lifestyle, hunting for fish and small reptiles around the water's edge. However, this resemblance is only superficial and is a prime-case of convergent evolution. 

True archosaurs appeared in the early Triassic, splitting into two branches: Avemetatarsalia (the ancestors to birds) and Pseudosuchia (the ancestors to crocodilians). Avemetatarsalians were a minor component of their ecosystems, but eventually produced the earliest pterosaurs and dinosaurs in the Late Triassic. Early long-tailed pterosaurs appeared in the Norian and quickly spread worldwide. Triassic dinosaurs evolved in the Carnian and include early sauropodomorphs and theropods. Most Triassic dinosaurs were small predators and only a few were common, such as Coelophysis , which was 1 to 2 metres (3.3 to 6.6 ft) long. Triassic sauropodomorphs primarily inhabited cooler regions of the world. [ 75 ] 

The large predator Smok was most likely also an archosaur, but it is uncertain if it was a primitive dinosaur or a pseudosuchian. 

Pseudosuchians were far more ecologically dominant in the Triassic, including large herbivores (such as aetosaurs ), large carnivores (" rauisuchians "), and the first crocodylomorphs (" sphenosuchians "). Aetosaurs were heavily-armored reptiles that were common during the last 30 million years of the Late Triassic until they died out at the Triassic-Jurassic extinction. Most aetosaurs were herbivorous and fed on low-growing plants, but some may have eaten meat. " rauisuchians " (formally known as paracrocodylomorphs ) were the keystone predators of most Triassic terrestrial ecosystems. Over 25 species have been found, including giant quadrupedal hunters, sleek bipedal omnivores, and lumbering beasts with deep sails on their backs. They probably occupied the large-predator niche later filled by theropods. "Rauisuchians" were ancestral to small, lightly-built crocodylomorphs, the only pseudosuchians which survived into the Jurassic.

# Marine reptiles 
[ edit ] 
Marine vertebrate apex predators of the Early Triassic and Anisian (Middle Triassic) [ 76 ] 

There were many types of marine reptiles. These included the Sauropterygia , which featured pachypleurosaurs and nothosaurs (both common during the Middle Triassic, especially in the Tethys region), placodonts , the earliest known herbivorous marine reptile Atopodentatus , and the first plesiosaurs . The first of the lizard-like Thalattosauria ( Askeptosaurus ) and the highly successful ichthyopterygians , which appeared in Early Triassic seas, soon diversified. By the Middle Triassic, some ichthyopterygians were achieving very large body masses. [ 77 ] 

# Other reptiles 
[ edit ] 

Among other reptiles, the earliest turtles , like Proganochelys and Proterochersis , appeared during the Norian Age (Stage) of the Late Triassic Period. The Lepidosauromorpha , specifically the Sphenodontia , are first found in the fossil record of the earlier Carnian Age, though the earliest lepidosauromorphs likely occurred in the Permian. The Procolophonidae , the last surviving parareptiles , were an important group of small lizard-like herbivores. The drepanosaurs were a clade of unusual, chameleon-like arboreal reptiles with birdlike heads and specialised claws. 

# Synapsids 
[ edit ] 

Three therapsid groups survived into the Triassic: dicynodonts , therocephalians , and cynodonts . The cynodont Cynognathus was a characteristic top predator in the Olenekian and Anisian of Gondwana . Both kannemeyeriiform dicynodonts and gomphodont cynodonts remained important herbivores during much of the period. Therocephalians included both large predators ( Moschorhinus ) and herbivorous forms ( bauriids ) until their extinction midway through the period. Ecteniniid cynodonts played a role as large-sized, cursorial predators in the Late Triassic. During the Carnian (early part of the Late Triassic), some advanced cynodonts gave rise to the first mammals . 

During the Triassic, archosaurs displaced therapsids as the largest and most ecologically prolific terrestrial amniotes. This "Triassic Takeover" may have contributed to the evolution of mammals by forcing the surviving therapsids and their mammaliaform successors to live as small, mainly nocturnal insectivores . Nocturnal life may have forced the mammaliaforms to develop fur and a higher metabolic rate . [ 78 ]

Lystrosaurus was a widespread dicynodont and the most common land vertebrate during the Early Triassic, after animal life had been greatly diminished 

- 

Cynognathus was a carnivorous mammal-like cynodont from the Early Triassic. 

# Lagerstätten 
[ edit ] 

Two Early Triassic lagerstätten (high-quality fossil beds), the Dienerian aged Guiyang biota [ 79 ] and the earliest Spathian aged Paris biota [ 80 ] stand out due to their exceptional preservation and diversity . They represent the earliest lagerstätten of the Mesozoic era and provide insight into the biotic recovery from the Permian-Triassic mass extinction event. 

The Monte San Giorgio lagerstätte, now in the Lake Lugano region of northern Italy and southern Switzerland , was in Middle Triassic times a lagoon behind reefs with an anoxic bottom layer, so there were no scavengers and little turbulence to disturb fossilization, a situation that can be compared to the better-known Jurassic Solnhofen Limestone lagerstätte . The remains of fish and various marine reptiles (including the common pachypleurosaur Neusticosaurus , and the bizarre long-necked archosauromorph Tanystropheus ), along with some terrestrial forms like Ticinosuchus and Macrocnemus , have been recovered from this locality. All these fossils date from the Anisian and Ladinian ages (about 242 Ma ago). 

# Triassic–Jurassic extinction event 
[ edit ] 

Main article: Triassic–Jurassic extinction event 
The mass extinction event is marked by 'End Tr' 

The Triassic Period ended with a mass extinction, which was particularly severe in the oceans; the conodonts disappeared, as did all the marine reptiles except ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs . Invertebrates like brachiopods and molluscs (such as gastropods ) were severely affected. In the oceans, 22% of marine families and possibly about half of marine genera went missing. 

Though the end-Triassic extinction event was not equally devastating in all terrestrial ecosystems, several important clades of crurotarsans (large archosaurian reptiles previously grouped together as the thecodonts ) disappeared, as did most of the large labyrinthodont amphibians, groups of small reptiles, and most synapsids. Some of the early, primitive dinosaurs also became extinct, but more adaptive ones survived to evolve into the Jurassic. Surviving plants that went on to dominate the Mesozoic world included modern conifers and cycadeoids. 

The cause of the Late Triassic extinction is uncertain. It was accompanied by huge volcanic eruptions that occurred as the supercontinent Pangaea began to break apart about 202 to 191 million years ago (40Ar/39Ar dates), [ 81 ] forming the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP), [ 82 ] one of the largest known inland volcanic events since the planet had first cooled and stabilized. Other possible but less likely causes for the extinction events include global cooling or even a bolide impact, for which an impact crater containing Manicouagan Reservoir in Quebec , Canada , has been singled out. However, the Manicouagan impact melt has been dated to 214±1 Mya. The date of the Triassic-Jurassic boundary has also been more accurately fixed recently, at 201.4 Mya. Both dates are gaining accuracy by using more accurate forms of radiometric dating, in particular the decay of uranium to lead in zircons formed at time of the impact. So, the evidence suggests the Manicouagan impact preceded the end of the Triassic by approximately 10±2 Ma. It could not therefore be the immediate cause of the observed mass extinction. [ 83 ] 
Skull of a Triassic Period phytosaur found in the Petrified Forest National Park 

The number of Late Triassic extinctions is disputed. Some studies suggest that there are at least two periods of extinction towards the end of the Triassic, separated by 12 to 17 million years. But arguing against this is a recent study of North American faunas. In the Petrified Forest of northeast Arizona there is a unique sequence of late Carnian-early Norian terrestrial sediments. An analysis in 2002 found no significant change in the paleoenvironment. [ 84 ] Phytosaurs , the most common fossils there, experienced a change-over only at the genus level, and the number of species remained the same. Some aetosaurs , the next most common tetrapods, and early dinosaurs, passed through unchanged. However, both phytosaurs and aetosaurs were among the groups of archosaur reptiles completely wiped out by the end-Triassic extinction event. 

It seems likely then that there was some sort of end-Carnian extinction, when several herbivorous archosauromorph groups died out, while the large herbivorous therapsids —the kannemeyeriid dicynodonts and the traversodont cynodonts—were much reduced in the northern half of Pangaea ( Laurasia ). 

These extinctions within the Triassic and at its end allowed the dinosaurs to expand into many niches that had become unoccupied. Dinosaurs became increasingly dominant, abundant and diverse, and remained that way for the next 150 million years. The true "Age of Dinosaurs" is during the following Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, rather than the Triassic.

The Jurassic ( / dʒ ʊ ˈ r æ s ɪ k / juurr- ASS -ik [ 2 ] ) is a geologic period and stratigraphic system that spanned from the end of the Triassic Period 201.4 Ma (million years ago) to the beginning of the Cretaceous Period, 143.1 Ma. The Jurassic constitutes the second and middle period of the Mesozoic Era as well as the eighth period of the Phanerozoic Eon and is named after the Jura Mountains , where limestone strata from the period were first identified. 

The start of the Jurassic was marked by the major Triassic–Jurassic extinction event , associated with the eruption of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP). The beginning of the Toarcian Age started around 183 Ma and is marked by the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event , a global episode of oceanic anoxia , ocean acidification , and elevated global temperatures associated with extinctions, likely caused by the eruption of the Karoo-Ferrar large igneous provinces . The end of the Jurassic, however, has no clear, definitive boundary with the Cretaceous and is the only boundary between geological periods to remain formally undefined. 

By the beginning of the Jurassic, the supercontinent Pangaea had begun rifting into two landmasses: Laurasia to the north and Gondwana to the south. The climate of the Jurassic was warmer than the present, and there were no ice caps . Forests grew close to the poles, with large arid expanses in the lower latitudes. 

On land, the fauna transitioned from the Triassic fauna, dominated jointly by dinosauromorph and pseudosuchian archosaurs , to one dominated by dinosaurs alone. The first stem-group birds appeared during the Jurassic, evolving from a branch of theropod dinosaurs. Other major events include the appearance of the earliest crabs and modern frogs , salamanders and lizards . Mammaliaformes , one of the few cynodont lineages to survive the end of the Triassic, continued to diversify throughout the period, with the Jurassic seeing the emergence of the first crown group mammals . Crocodylomorphs made the transition from a terrestrial to an aquatic life. The oceans were inhabited by marine reptiles such as ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs , while pterosaurs were the dominant flying vertebrates . Modern sharks and rays first appeared and diversified during the period, while the first known crown-group teleost fish (the dominant group of modern fish) appeared near the end of the period. The flora was dominated by ferns and gymnosperms , including conifers , of which many modern groups made their first appearance during the period, as well as other groups like the extinct Bennettitales . 

# Etymology and history 
[ edit ] 
Portrait of Alexandre Brongniart , who coined the term "Jurassic" 

The chronostratigraphic term "Jurassic" is linked to the Jura Mountains , a forested mountain range that mainly follows the France–Switzerland border . The name "Jura" is derived from the Celtic root * jor via Gaulish *iuris "wooded mountain", which was borrowed into Latin as a name of a place and evolved into Juria and finally Jura . [ citation needed ] 

During a tour of the region in 1795, German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt recognized carbonate deposits within the Jura Mountains as geologically distinct from the Triassic aged Muschelkalk of southern Germany , but he erroneously concluded that they were older. He then named them Jura-Kalkstein ('Jura limestone') in 1799. [ 3 ] 

In 1829, the French naturalist Alexandre Brongniart published a book entitled Description of the Terrains that Constitute the Crust of the Earth or Essay on the Structure of the Known Lands of the Earth. In this book, Brongniart used the phrase terrains jurassiques when correlating the "Jura-Kalkstein" of Humboldt with similarly aged oolitic limestones in Britain, thus coining and publishing the term "Jurassic". [ 4 ] [ 3 ] 

The German geologist Leopold von Buch in 1839 established the three-fold division of the Jurassic, originally named from oldest to the youngest: the Black Jurassic , Brown Jurassic , and White Jurassic . [ 5 ] The term " Lias " had previously been used for strata of equivalent age to the Black Jurassic in England by William Conybeare and William Phillips in 1822. William Phillips, the geologist, worked with William Conybeare to find out more about the Black Jurassic in England. 

The French palaeontologist Alcide d'Orbigny in papers between 1842 and 1852 divided the Jurassic into ten stages based on ammonite and other fossil assemblages in England and France, of which seven are still used, but none has retained its original definition. The German geologist and palaeontologist Friedrich August von Quenstedt in 1858 divided the three series of von Buch in the Swabian Jura into six subdivisions defined by ammonites and other fossils. 

The German palaeontologist Albert Oppel in his studies between 1856 and 1858 altered d'Orbigny's original scheme and further subdivided the stages into biostratigraphic zones, based primarily on ammonites. Most of the modern stages of the Jurassic were formalized at the Colloque du Jurassique à Luxembourg in 1962. [ 3 ] 

# Geology 
[ edit ] 

The Jurassic Period is divided into three epochs : Early, Middle, and Late. Similarly, in stratigraphy , the Jurassic is divided into the Lower Jurassic , Middle Jurassic , and Upper Jurassic series . Geologists divide the rocks of the Jurassic into a stratigraphic set of units called stages , each formed during corresponding time intervals called ages. 

Stages can be defined globally or regionally. For global stratigraphic correlation, the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) ratify global stages based on a Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) from a single formation (a stratotype ) identifying the lower boundary of the stage. [ 3 ] The ages of the Jurassic from youngest to oldest are as follows: [ 6 ] 
Series/epoch Stage/age Lower boundary Early Cretaceous Berriasian 143.1 ± 0.6 Ma Upper/Late Jurassic Tithonian 149.2 ± 0.7 Ma Kimmeridgian 154.8 ± 0.8 Ma Oxfordian 161.5 ± 1.0 Ma Middle Jurassic Callovian 165.3 ± 1.1 Ma Bathonian 168.2 ± 1.2 Ma Bajocian 170.9 ± 0.8 Ma Aalenian 174.7 ± 0.8 Ma Lower/Early Jurassic Toarcian 184.2 ± 0.3 Ma Pliensbachian 192.9 ± 0.3 Ma Sinemurian 199.5 ± 0.3 Ma Hettangian 201.4 ± 0.2 Ma

Jurassic stratigraphy is primarily based on the use of ammonites as index fossils . The first appearance datum of specific ammonite taxa is used to mark the beginnings of stages, as well as smaller timespans within stages, referred to as "ammonite zones"; these, in turn, are also sometimes subdivided further into subzones. Global stratigraphy is based on standard European ammonite zones, with other regions being calibrated to the European successions. [ 3 ]

# Early Jurassic 
[ edit ] 

The oldest part of the Jurassic Period has historically been referred to as the Lias or Liassic, roughly equivalent in extent to the Early Jurassic, but also including part of the preceding Rhaetian . The Hettangian Stage was named by Swiss palaeontologist Eugène Renevier in 1864 after Hettange-Grande in north-eastern France. [ 3 ] The GSSP for the base of the Hettangian is located at the Kuhjoch Pass, Karwendel Mountains , Northern Calcareous Alps , Austria; it was ratified in 2010. The beginning of the Hettangian, and thus the Jurassic as a whole, is marked by the first appearance of the ammonite Psiloceras spelae tirolicum in the Kendlbach Formation exposed at Kuhjoch. [ 7 ] The base of the Jurassic was previously defined as the first appearance of Psiloceras planorbis by Albert Oppel in 1856–58, but this was changed as the appearance was seen as too localised an event for an international boundary. [ 3 ] 

The Sinemurian Stage was first defined and introduced into scientific literature by Alcide d'Orbigny in 1842. It takes its name from the French town of Semur-en-Auxois , near Dijon . The original definition of Sinemurian included what is now the Hettangian. The GSSP of the Sinemurian is located at a cliff face north of the hamlet of East Quantoxhead , 6 kilometres east of Watchet , Somerset , England , within the Blue Lias , and was ratified in 2000. The beginning of the Sinemurian is defined by the first appearance of the ammonite Vermiceras quantoxense . [ 3 ] [ 8 ] 

Albert Oppel in 1858 named the Pliensbachian Stage after the hamlet of Pliensbach in the community of Zell unter Aichelberg in the Swabian Alb , near Stuttgart , Germany. The GSSP for the base of the Pliensbachian is found at the Wine Haven locality in Robin Hood's Bay , Yorkshire , England, in the Redcar Mudstone Formation , and was ratified in 2005. The beginning of the Pliensbachian is defined by the first appearance of the ammonite Bifericeras donovani . [ 9 ] 

The village Thouars (Latin: Toarcium ), just south of Saumur in the Loire Valley of France , lends its name to the Toarcian Stage. The Toarcian was named by Alcide d'Orbigny in 1842, with the original locality being Vrines quarry around 2 km northwest of Thouars. The GSSP for the base of the Toarcian is located at Peniche, Portugal , and was ratified in 2014. The boundary is defined by the first appearance of ammonites belonging to the subgenus Dactylioceras ( Eodactylites ) . [ 10 ] 

# Middle Jurassic 
[ edit ] 

The Aalenian is named after the city of Aalen in Germany. The Aalenian was defined by Swiss geologist Karl Mayer-Eymar in 1864. The lower boundary was originally between the dark clays of the Black Jurassic and the overlying clayey sandstone and ferruginous oolite of the Brown Jurassic sequences of southwestern Germany. [ 3 ] The GSSP for the base of the Aalenian is located at Fuentelsaz in the Iberian range near Guadalajara, Spain , and was ratified in 2000. The base of the Aalenian is defined by the first appearance of the ammonite Leioceras opalinum . [ 11 ] 

Alcide d'Orbigny in 1842 named the Bajocian Stage after the town of Bayeux (Latin: Bajoce ) in Normandy, France. The GSSP for the base of the Bajocian is located in the Murtinheira section at Cabo Mondego , Portugal; it was ratified in 1997. The base of the Bajocian is defined by the first appearance of the ammonite Hyperlioceras mundum . [ 12 ] 

The Bathonian is named after the city of Bath , England, introduced by Belgian geologist d'Omalius d'Halloy in 1843, after an incomplete section of oolitic limestones in several quarries in the region. The GSSP for the base of the Bathonian is Ravin du Bès, Bas-Auran area, Alpes de Haute Provence , France; it was ratified in 2009. The base of the Bathonian is defined by the first appearance of the ammonite Gonolkites convergens , at the base of the Zigzagiceras zigzag ammonite zone . [ 13 ] 

The Callovian is derived from the Latinized name of the village of Kellaways in Wiltshire , England, and was named by Alcide d'Orbigny in 1852, originally the base at the contact between the Forest Marble Formation and the Cornbrash Formation . However, this boundary was later found to be within the upper part of the Bathonian. [ 3 ] The base of the Callovian does not yet have a certified GSSP. The working definition for the base of the Callovian is the first appearance of ammonites belonging to the genus Kepplerites . [ 14 ] 

# Late Jurassic 
[ edit ] 

The Oxfordian is named after the city of Oxford in England and was named by Alcide d'Orbigny in 1844 in reference to the Oxford Clay . The base of the Oxfordian lacks a defined GSSP. W. J. Arkell in studies in 1939 and 1946 placed the lower boundary of the Oxfordian as the first appearance of the ammonite Quenstedtoceras mariae (then placed in the genus Vertumniceras ). Subsequent proposals have suggested the first appearance of Cardioceras redcliffense as the lower boundary. [ 3 ] [ 14 ] 
Kimmeridge Clay at Egmont Bight in the Jurassic Coast , southern England 

The village of Kimmeridge on the coast of Dorset , England, is the origin of the name of the Kimmeridgian. The stage was named by Alcide d'Orbigny in 1842 in reference to the Kimmeridge Clay . The GSSP for the base of the Kimmeridgian is the Flodigarry section at Staffin Bay on the Isle of Skye , Scotland, [ 15 ] which was ratified in 2021. The boundary is defined by the first appearance of ammonites marking the boreal Bauhini Zone and the subboreal Baylei Zone. [ 14 ] 

The Tithonian was introduced in scientific literature by Albert Oppel in 1865. The name Tithonian is unusual in geological stage names because it is derived from Greek mythology rather than a place name. Tithonus was the son of Laomedon of Troy and fell in love with Eos , the Greek goddess of dawn . His name was chosen by Albert Oppel for this stratigraphical stage because the Tithonian finds itself hand in hand with the dawn of the Cretaceous. The base of the Tithonian currently lacks a GSSP. [ 3 ] The working definition for the base of the Tithonian is the first appearance of the ammonite genus Gravesia . [ 14 ] 

The upper boundary of the Jurassic is currently undefined, and the Jurassic–Cretaceous boundary is currently the only system boundary to lack a defined GSSP. Placing a GSSP for this boundary has been difficult because of the strong regionality of most biostratigraphic markers, and lack of any chemostratigraphic events, such as isotope excursions (large sudden changes in ratios of isotopes ), that could be used to define or correlate a boundary. Calpionellids , an enigmatic group of planktonic protists with urn-shaped calcitic tests briefly abundant during the latest Jurassic to earliest Cretaceous, have been suggested to represent the most promising candidates for fixing the Jurassic–Cretaceous boundary [ 16 ] In particular, the first appearance Calpionella alpina , co-inciding with the base of the eponymous Alpina subzone, has been proposed as the definition of the base of the Cretaceous. [ 17 ] The working definition for the boundary has often been placed as the first appearance of the ammonite Strambergella jacobi , formerly placed in the genus Berriasella , but its use as a stratigraphic indicator has been questioned, as its first appearance does not correlate with that of C. alpina . [ 18 ] 

# Mineral and hydrocarbon deposits 
[ edit ] 

The Kimmeridge Clay and equivalents are the major source rock for the North Sea oil . [ 19 ] The Arabian Intrashelf Basin, deposited during the Middle and Late Jurassic, is the setting of the world's largest oil reserves, including the Ghawar Field , the world's largest oil field. [ 20 ] The Jurassic-aged Sargelu [ 21 ] and Naokelekan formations [ 22 ] are major source rocks for oil in Iraq . Over 1500 gigatons of Jurassic coal reserves are found in north-west China, primarily in the Turpan-Hami Basin and the Ordos Basin . [ 23 ] 

# Impact structures 
[ edit ] 

Major impact structures include the Morokweng impact structure , a 70 km diameter impact structure buried beneath the Kalahari desert in northern South Africa. The impact is dated to the Tithonian, approximately 146.06 ± 0.16 Ma. [ 24 ] Another major structure is the Puchezh-Katunki crater , 40 kilometres in diameter, buried beneath Nizhny Novgorod Oblast in western Russia. The impact has been dated to the Sinemurian, 195.9 ± 1.0 Ma. [ 25 ] 

# Paleogeography and tectonics 
[ edit ] 
Map of geography during the Early Jurassic, around 190 million years ago 

At the beginning of the Jurassic, all of the world's major landmasses were coalesced into the supercontinent Pangaea , which during the Early Jurassic began to break up into northern supercontinent Laurasia and the southern supercontinent Gondwana . [ 26 ] The rifting between North America and Africa was the first to initiate, beginning in the early Jurassic, associated with the emplacement of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province . [ 27 ] 
Map of Europe during the Toarcian Age 

During the Jurassic, the North Atlantic Ocean remained relatively narrow, while the South Atlantic did not open until the Cretaceous. [ 28 ] [ 27 ] The continents were surrounded by Panthalassa , with the Tethys Ocean between Gondwana and Asia. At the end of the Triassic, there was a marine transgression in Europe, flooding most parts of central and western Europe transforming it into an archipelago of islands surrounded by shallow seas. [ 29 ] During the Jurassic, both the North and South Pole were covered by oceans. [ 26 ] Beginning in the Early Jurassic, the Boreal Ocean was connected to the proto-Atlantic by the "Viking corridor" or Transcontinental Laurasian Seaway, a passage between the Baltic Shield and Greenland several hundred kilometers wide. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] During the Callovian, the Turgai Epicontinental Sea formed, creating a marine barrier between Europe and Asia. [ 33 ] 
Map of global geography during the Late Jurassic, around 155 million years ago 

Madagascar and Antarctica began to rift away from Africa during the late Early Jurassic in association with the eruption of the Karoo-Ferrar large igneous provinces , opening the western Indian Ocean and beginning the fragmentation of Gondwana. [ 34 ] [ 35 ] At the beginning of the Jurassic, North and South America remained connected, but by the beginning of the Late Jurassic they had rifted apart to form the Caribbean Seaway, also known as the Hispanic Corridor, which connected the North Atlantic Ocean with eastern Panthalassa. Palaeontological data suggest that the seaway had been open since the Early Jurassic. [ 36 ] 

As part of the Nevadan orogeny , which began during the Triassic, the Cache Creek Ocean closed, and various terranes including the large Wrangellia Terrane accreted onto the western margin of North America. [ 37 ] [ 38 ] By the Middle Jurassic the Siberian plate and the North China-Amuria block had collided, resulting in the closure of the Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean . [ 39 ] 
Formation of the Pacific Plate during the Early Jurassic 

During the Early Jurassic, around 190 million years ago, the Pacific Plate originated at the triple junction of the Farallon , Phoenix , and Izanagi tectonic plates , the three main oceanic plates of Panthalassa. The previously stable triple junction had converted to an unstable arrangement surrounded on all sides by transform faults because of a kink in one of the plate boundaries, resulting in the formation of the Pacific Plate at the centre of the junction. [ 40 ] During the Middle to early Late Jurassic, the Sundance Seaway , a shallow epicontinental sea , covered much of northwest North America. [ 41 ]

The eustatic sea level is estimated to have been close to present levels during the Hettangian and Sinemurian, rising several tens of metres during the late Sinemurian–Pliensbachian before regressing to near present levels by the late Pliensbachian. There seems to have been a gradual rise to a peak of ~75 m above present sea level during the Toarcian. During the latest part of the Toarcian, the sea level again dropped by several tens of metres. It progressively rose from the Aalenian onwards, aside from dips of a few tens of metres in the Bajocian and around the Callovian–Oxfordian boundary, peaking possibly as high as 140 metres above present sea level at the Kimmeridgian–Tithonian boundary. The sea levels falls in the late Tithonian, perhaps to around 100 metres, before rebounding to around 110 metres at the Tithonian–Berriasian boundary. 

The sea level within the long-term trends across the Jurassic was cyclical, with 64 fluctuations, 15 of which were over 75 metres. The most noted cyclicity in Jurassic rocks is fourth order, with a periodicity of approximately 410,000 years. [ 42 ] 

During the Early Jurassic the world's oceans transitioned from an aragonite sea to a calcite sea chemistry, favouring the dissolution of aragonite and precipitation of calcite . [ 43 ] The rise of calcareous plankton during the Middle Jurassic profoundly altered ocean chemistry, with the deposition of biomineralized plankton on the ocean floor acting as a buffer against large CO 2 emissions. [ 44 ] 

# Climate 
[ edit ] 

The climate of the Jurassic was generally warmer than that of present, by around 5–10 °C (9–18 °F), with atmospheric carbon dioxide likely about four times higher. Intermittent "cold snap" intervals are known to have occurred during this time period, however, interrupting the otherwise warm greenhouse climate. [ 45 ] Forests likely grew near the poles, where they experienced warm summers and cold, sometimes snowy winters; there were unlikely to have been ice sheets given the high summer temperatures that prevented the accumulation of snow, though there may have been mountain glaciers. [ 46 ] Dropstones and glendonites in northeastern Siberia during the Early to Middle Jurassic indicate cold winters. [ 47 ] The ocean depths were likely 8 °C (14 °F) warmer than present, and coral reefs grew 10° of latitude further north and south. The Intertropical Convergence Zone likely existed over the oceans, resulting in large areas of desert and scrubland in the lower latitudes between 40° N and S of the equator. Tropical rainforest and tundra biomes are likely to have been rare or absent. [ 46 ] The Jurassic also witnessed the decline of the Pangaean megamonsoon that had characterised the preceding Permian and Triassic periods. [ 48 ] Variation in the frequency of wildfire activity in the Jurassic was governed by the 405 kyr eccentricity cycle. [ 49 ] Thanks to the breakup of Pangaea, the hydrological cycle during the Jurassic was significantly enhanced. [ 50 ] 

The beginning of the Jurassic was likely marked by a thermal spike corresponding to the Triassic–Jurassic extinction and eruption of the Central Atlantic magmatic province. The first part of the Jurassic was marked by the Early Jurassic Cool Interval between 199 and 183 million years ago. [ 47 ] It has been proposed that glaciation was present in the Northern Hemisphere during both the early Pliensbachian [ 51 ] and the latest Pliensbachian. [ 52 ] [ 53 ] There was a spike in global temperatures of around 4–8 °C (7–14 °F) during the early part of the Toarcian corresponding to the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event and the eruption of the Karoo-Ferrar large igneous provinces in southern Gondwana, with the warm interval extending to the end of the Toarcian around 174 million years ago. [ 47 ] During the Toarcian Warm Interval, ocean surface temperatures likely exceeded 30 °C (86 °F), and equatorial and subtropical (30°N–30°S) regions are likely to have been extremely arid, with temperatures in the interior of Pangea likely in excess of 40 °C (104 °F).The Toarcian Warm Interval is followed by the Middle Jurassic Cool Interval (MJCI) between 174 and 164 Ma, [ 47 ] which may have been punctuated by brief, ephemeral icehouse intervals. [ 54 ] [ 55 ] During the Aalenian, precessionally forced climatic changes dictated peatland wildfire magnitude and frequency. [ 56 ] The European climate appears to have become noticeably more humid at the Aalenian-Bajocian boundary but then became more arid during the middle Bajocian. [ 57 ] A transient ice age possibly occurred in the late Bajocian. [ 58 ] The Callovian-Oxfordian boundary at the end of the MJCI witnessed particularly notable global cooling, [ 59 ] [ 60 ] potentially even an ice age. [ 61 ] This is followed by the Kimmeridgian Warm Interval (KWI) between 164 and 150 Ma. [ 47 ] Based on fossil wood distribution, this was one of the wettest intervals of the Jurassic. [ 62 ] The Pangaean interior had less severe seasonal swings than in previous warm periods as the expansion of the Central Atlantic and Western Indian Ocean provided new sources of moisture. [ 47 ] A prominent drop in temperatures occurred during the Tithonian, known as the Early Tithonian Cooling Event (ETCE). [ 60 ] The end of the Jurassic was marked by the Tithonian–early Barremian Cool Interval (TBCI), beginning 150 Ma and continuing into the Early Cretaceous . [ 47 ]

# Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event 
[ edit ] 

Main article: Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event 

The Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (TOAE), also known as the Jenkyns Event, was an episode of widespread oceanic anoxia during the early part of the Toarcian Age, c. 183 Ma. It is marked by a globally documented high amplitude negative carbon isotope excursion, [ 63 ] [ 64 ] as well as the deposition of black shales [ 65 ] and the extinction and collapse of carbonate-producing marine organisms, associated with a major rise in global temperatures. [ 66 ] 

The TOAE is often attributed to the eruption of the Karoo-Ferrar large igneous provinces and the associated increase of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere, as well as the possible associated release of methane clathrates . [ 66 ] This likely accelerated the hydrological cycle and increased silicate weathering , as evidenced by an increased amount of organic matter of terrestrial origin found in marine deposits during the TOAE. [ 67 ] Groups affected include ammonites, [ 68 ] ostracods , [ 65 ] [ 69 ] foraminifera , [ 70 ] [ 71 ] bivalves , [ 65 ] cnidarians , and especially brachiopods , [ 72 ] [ 73 ] [ 74 ] for which the TOAE represented one of the most severe extinctions in their evolutionary history. [ 75 ] While the event had significant impact on marine invertebrates, it had little effect on marine reptiles. [ 76 ] During the TOAE, the Sichuan Basin was transformed into a giant lake , probably three times the size of modern-day Lake Superior , represented by the Da'anzhai Member of the Ziliujing Formation . The lake likely sequestered ~460 gigatons (Gt) of organic carbon and ~1,200 Gt of inorganic carbon during the event. [ 77 ] Seawater pH , which had already substantially decreased prior to the event, increased slightly during the early stages of the TOAE, before dropping to its lowest point around the middle of the event. [ 78 ] This ocean acidification is the probable cause of the collapse of carbonate production. [ 79 ] [ 80 ] Additionally, anoxic conditions were exacerbated by enhanced recycling of phosphorus back into ocean water as a result of high ocean acidity and temperature inhibiting its mineralisation into apatite; the abundance of phosphorus in marine environments caused further eutrophication and consequent anoxia in a positive feedback loop. [ 81 ] 

# End-Jurassic transition 
[ edit ] 

Main article: Tithonian extinction event 

The end-Jurassic transition was originally considered one of eight mass extinctions, but is now considered to be a complex interval of faunal turnover, with the increase in diversity of some groups and decline in others, though the evidence for this is primarily European, probably controlled by changes in eustatic sea level. [ 82 ] 

# Flora 
[ edit ] 

# End-Triassic extinction 
[ edit ] 

There is no evidence of a mass extinction of plants at the Triassic–Jurassic boundary. [ 83 ] At the Triassic–Jurassic boundary in Greenland, the sporomorph (pollen and spores) record suggests a complete floral turnover. [ 84 ] An analysis of macrofossil floral communities in Europe suggests that changes were mainly due to local ecological succession . [ 85 ] At the end of the Triassic, the Peltaspermaceae became extinct in most parts of the world, with Lepidopteris persisting into the Early Jurassic in Patagonia. [ 86 ] Dicroidium , a corystosperm seed fern that was a dominant part of Gondwanan floral communities during the Triassic, also declined at the Triassic–Jurassic boundary, surviving as a relict in Antarctica into the Early Jurassic. [ 87 ] 

# Floral composition 
[ edit ] 

# Conifers 
[ edit ] 
Petrified Araucaria mirabilis cone from the Middle Jurassic of Argentina 

Conifers formed a dominant component of Jurassic floras. The Late Triassic and Jurassic was a major time of diversification of conifers, with most modern conifer groups appearing in the fossil record by the end of the Jurassic, having evolved from voltzialean ancestors. [ 88 ] [ 89 ] 

Araucarian conifers have their first unambiguous records during the Early Jurassic, and members of the modern genus Araucaria were widespread across both hemispheres by the Middle Jurassic. [ 89 ] [ 90 ] [ 91 ] 

Also abundant during the Jurassic is the extinct family Cheirolepidiaceae , often recognised through their highly distinctive Classopolis pollen. Jurassic representatives include the pollen cone Classostrobus and the seed cone Pararaucaria . Araucarian and Cheirolepidiaceae conifers often occur in association. [ 92 ] 

The oldest definitive record of the cypress family ( Cupressaceae ) is Austrohamia minuta from the Early Jurassic (Pliensbachian) of Patagonia, known from many parts of the plant. [ 93 ] The reproductive structures of Austrohamia have strong similarities to those of the primitive living cypress genera Taiwania and Cunninghamia . By the Middle to Late Jurassic Cupressaceae were abundant in warm temperate–tropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere, most abundantly represented by the genus Elatides . [ 94 ] The Jurassic also saw the first appearances of some modern genera of cypresses, such as Sequoia . [ 95 ] 

Members of the extinct genus Schizolepidopsis which likely represent a stem-group to the pine family ( Pinaceae ), were widely distributed across Eurasia during the Jurassic. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] The oldest unambiguous record of Pinaceae is the pine cone Eathiestrobus , known from the Late Jurassic (Kimmeridgian) of Scotland, which remains the only known unequivocal fossil of the group before the Cretaceous. [ 98 ] Despite being the earliest known member of the Pinaceae, Eathiestrobus appears to be a member of the pinoid clade of the family, suggesting that the initial diversification of Pinaceae occurred earlier than has been found in the fossil record. [ 99 ] [ 89 ] 

The earliest record of the yew family ( Taxaceae ) is Palaeotaxus rediviva , from the Hettangian of Sweden, suggested to be closely related to the living Austrotaxus , while Marskea jurassica from the Middle Jurassic of Yorkshire, England and material from the Callovian–Oxfordian Daohugou Bed in China are thought to be closely related to Amentotaxus , with the latter material assigned to the modern genus, indicating that Taxaceae had substantially diversified by the end of the Jurassic. [ 100 ] 

The oldest unambiguous members of Podocarpaceae are known from the Jurassic, found across both hemispheres, including Scarburgia and Harrisiocarpus from the Middle Jurassic of England, as well as unnamed species from the Middle-Late Jurassic of Patagonia. [ 101 ] 

During the Early Jurassic, the flora of the mid-latitudes of Eastern Asia were dominated by the extinct deciduous broad leafed conifer Podozamites , which appears to not be closely related to any living family of conifer. Its range extended northwards into polar latitudes of Siberia and then contracted northward in the Middle to Late Jurassic, corresponding to the increasing aridity of the region. [ 102 ] 

# Ginkgoales 
[ edit ] 
Leaves of Ginkgo huttonii from the Middle Jurassic of England 

Ginkgoales , of which the sole living species is Ginkgo biloba , were more diverse during the Jurassic: they were among the most important components of Eurasian Jurassic floras and were adapted to a wide variety of climatic conditions. [ 103 ] The earliest representatives of the genus Ginkgo , represented by ovulate and pollen organs similar to those of the modern species, are known from the Middle Jurassic in the Northern Hemisphere. [ 103 ] Several other lineages of ginkgoaleans are known from Jurassic rocks, including Yimaia , Grenana , Nagrenia and Karkenia . These lineages are associated with Ginkgo- like leaves, but are distinguished from living and fossil representatives of Ginkgo by having differently arranged reproductive structures. [ 103 ] [ 104 ] Umaltolepis from the Jurassic of Asia has strap-shaped ginkgo-like leaves with highly distinct reproductive structures with similarities to those of peltasperm and corystosperm seed ferns, has been suggested to be a member of Ginkgoales sensu lato. [ 105 ] 

# Bennettitales 
[ edit ] 
Restoration of a member of Bennettitales belonging to Williamsoniaceae. 

Bennettitales , having first become widespread during the preceding Triassic, were diverse and abundant members of Jurassic floras across both hemispheres. [ 106 ] The foliage of Bennettitales bears strong similarities to those of cycads, to such a degree that they cannot be reliably distinguished on the basis of morphology alone. Leaves of Bennettitales can be distinguished from those of cycads their different arrangement of stomata , and the two groups are not thought to be closely related. [ 107 ] Jurassic Bennettitales predominantly belong to the group Williamsoniaceae , [ 106 ] which grew as shrubs and small trees. The Williamsoniaceae are thought to have had a divaricate branching habit, similar to that of living Banksia , and adapted to growing in open habitats with poor soil nutrient conditions. [ 108 ] Bennettitales exhibit complex, flower -like reproductive structures some of which are thought to have been pollinated by insects. Several groups of insects that bear long proboscis, including extinct families such as kalligrammatid lacewings [ 109 ] and extant ones such as acrocerid flies, [ 110 ] are suggested to have been pollinators of bennettitales, feeding on nectar produced by bennettitalean cones. 

# Cycads 
[ edit ] 

Cycads reached their apex of diversity during the Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods. [ 111 ] Despite the Mesozoic sometimes being called the "Age of Cycads", cycads are thought to have been a relatively minor component of mid-Mesozoic floras, with the Bennettitales and Nilssoniales , which have cycad-like foliage, being dominant. [ 112 ] The Nilssoniales have often been considered cycads or cycad relatives, but have been found to be distinct on chemical grounds, and perhaps more closely allied with Bennettitales. [ 113 ] The relationships of most Mesozoic cycads to living groups are ambiguous, [ 112 ] with no Jurassic cycads belonging to either of the two modern groups of cycads, though some Jurassic cycads possibly represent stem-group relatives of modern Cycadaceae , like the leaf genus Paracycas known Europe, and Zamiaceae , like some European species of the leaf genus Pseudoctenis . Also widespread during the Jurassic was the extinct Ctenis lineage, which appears to be distantly related to modern cycads. [ 114 ] Modern cycads are pollinated by beetles, and such an association is thought to have formed by the Early Jurassic. [ 111 ] 

# Other seed plants 
[ edit ] 

Although there have been several claimed records, there are no widely accepted Jurassic fossil records of flowering plants , which make up 90% of living plant species, and fossil evidence suggests that the group diversified during the following Cretaceous. [ 115 ] 

The earliest known gnetophytes , one of the four main living groups of gymnosperms , appeared by the end of the Jurassic, with the oldest unequivocal gnetophyte being the seed Dayvaultia from the Late Jurassic of North America. [ 116 ] 
Life restoration of the stem and leaves of a member of the extinct seed plant order Caytoniales , a group which reached its apex of abundance during the Jurassic, and which may be closely related to living flowering plants . 

"Seed ferns" ( Pteridospermatophyta ) is a collective term to refer to disparate lineages of fern like plants that produce seeds but have uncertain affinities to living seed plant groups. A prominent group of Jurassic seed ferns is the Caytoniales , which reached their zenith during the Jurassic, with widespread records in the Northern Hemisphere, though records in the Southern Hemisphere remain rare. Due to their berry -like seed-bearing capsules, they have often been suggested to have been closely related or perhaps ancestral to flowering plants, but the evidence for this is inconclusive. [ 117 ] Corystosperm -aligned seed ferns, such as Pachypteris and Komlopteris were widespread across both hemispheres during the Jurassic. [ 118 ] 

Czekanowskiales , also known as Leptostrobales, are a group of seed plants uncertain affinities with persistent heavily dissected leaves borne on deciduous short shoots, subtended by scale-like leaves, known from the Late Triassic (possibly Late Permian [ 119 ] ) to Cretaceous. [ 120 ] They are thought to have had a tree- or shrub-like habit and formed a conspicuous component of Northern Hemisphere Mesozoic temperate and warm-temperate floras. [ 119 ] The genus Phoenicopsis was widespread in Early-Middle Jurassic floras of Eastern Asia and Siberia. [ 121 ] 

The Pentoxylales , a small but clearly distinct group of liana -like seed plants of obscure affinities, first appeared during the Jurassic. Their distribution appears to have been confined to Eastern Gondwana. [ 122 ] 

# Ferns and allies 
[ edit ] 

Living families of ferns widespread during the Jurassic include Dipteridaceae , Matoniaceae , Gleicheniaceae , Osmundaceae and Marattiaceae . [ 123 ] [ 124 ] Polypodiales , which make up 80% of living fern diversity, have no record from the Jurassic and are thought to have diversified in the Cretaceous, [ 125 ] though the widespread Jurassic herbaceous fern genus Coniopteris , historically interpreted as a close relative of tree ferns of the family Dicksoniaceae , has recently been reinterpreted as an early relative of the group. [ 126 ] 

The Cyatheales , the group containing most modern tree ferns, appeared during the Late Jurassic, represented by members of the genus Cyathocaulis , which are suggested to be early members of Cyatheaceae on the basis of cladistic analysis. [ 127 ] Only a handful of possible records exist of the Hymenophyllaceae from the Jurassic, including Hymenophyllites macrosporangiatus from the Russian Jurassic. [ 128 ] 

The oldest remains of modern horsetails of the genus Equisetum first appear in the Early Jurassic, represented by Equisetum dimorphum from the Early Jurassic of Patagonia [ 129 ] and Equisetum laterale from the Early to Middle Jurassic of Australia. [ 130 ] [ 131 ] Silicified remains of Equisetum thermale from the Late Jurassic of Argentina exhibit all the morphological characters of modern members of the genus. [ 132 ] The estimated split between Equisetum bogotense and all other living Equisetum is estimated to have occurred no later than the Early Jurassic. [ 131 ] 

# Lower plants 
[ edit ] 

Quillworts virtually identical to modern species are known from the Jurassic onwards. Isoetites rolandii from the Middle Jurassic of Oregon is the earliest known species to represent all major morphological features of modern Isoetes . More primitive forms such as Nathorstiana , which retain an elongated stem, persisted into the Early Cretaceous. [ 133 ] 

The moss Kulindobryum from the Middle Jurassic of Russia, which was found associated with dinosaur bones, is thought to be related to the Splachnaceae , which grow on animal caracasses. [ 134 ] Bryokhutuliinia from the same region is thought to be related to Dicranales . [ 134 ] Heinrichsiella from the Jurassic of Patagonia is thought to belong to either Polytrichaceae or Timmiellaceae . [ 135 ] 

The liverwort Pellites hamiensis from the Middle Jurassic Xishanyao Formation of China is the oldest record of the family Pelliaceae . [ 136 ] Pallaviciniites sandaolingensis from the same deposit is thought to belong to the subclass Pallaviciniineae within the Pallaviciniales . [ 137 ] Ricciopsis sandaolingensis , also from the same deposit, is the only Jurassic record of Ricciaceae . [ 138 ] 

# Fauna 
[ edit ] 

# Dinosaurs 
[ edit ] 

Dinosaurs , which had morphologically diversified in the Late Triassic, experienced a major increase in diversity and abundance during the Early Jurassic in the aftermath of the end-Triassic extinction and the extinction of other reptile groups, becoming the dominant vertebrates in terrestrial ecosystems. [ 139 ] [ 140 ] Chilesaurus , a morphologically aberrant herbivorous dinosaur from the Late Jurassic of South America, has uncertain relationships to the three main groups of dinosaurs, having been recovered as a member of all three in different analyses. [ 141 ] 

# Theropods 
[ edit ] 

Advanced theropods belonging to Neotheropoda first appeared in the Late Triassic. Basal neotheropods, such as coelophysoids and dilophosaurs , persisted into the Early Jurassic, but became extinct by the Middle Jurassic. [ 142 ] The earliest averostrans appear during the Early Jurassic, with the earliest known member of Ceratosauria being Saltriovenator from the early Sinemurian (199.3–197.5 Ma) of Italy. [ 143 ] The unusual ceratosaur Limusaurus from the Late Jurassic of China had a herbivorous diet, with adults having edentulous beaked jaws, [ 144 ] making it the earliest known theropod to have converted from an ancestrally carnivorous diet. [ 145 ] The earliest members of the Tetanurae appeared during the late Early Jurassic or early Middle Jurassic. [ 146 ] The Megalosauridae represent the oldest radiation of the Tetanurae, first appearing in Europe during the Bajocian. [ 147 ] The oldest member of Allosauroidea has been suggested to be Asfaltovenator from the Middle Jurassic of South America. [ 146 ] Coelurosaurs first appeared during the Middle Jurassic, including early tyrannosaurs such as Proceratosaurus from the Bathonian of Britain. [ 148 ] Some coelurosaurs from the Late Jurassic of China including Shishugounykus and Haplocheirus are suggested to represent early alvarezsaurs , [ 149 ] however, this has been questioned. [ 150 ] Scansoriopterygids , a group of small feathered coelurosaurs with membraneous, bat-like wings for gliding, are known from the Middle to Late Jurassic of China. [ 151 ] The oldest record of troodontids is suggested to be Hesperornithoides from the Late Jurassic of North America. Tooth remains suggested to represent those of dromaeosaurs are known from the Jurassic, but no body remains are known until the Cretaceous. [ 152 ]

# Birds 
[ edit ] 
Archaeopteryx lithographica from the Late Jurassic (Tithonian) of Germany 

The earliest avialans , which include birds and their ancestors, appear during the Middle to Late Jurassic, definitively represented by Archaeopteryx from the Late Jurassic of Germany. Avialans belong to the clade Paraves within Coelurosauria, which also includes dromaeosaurs and troodontids. The Anchiornithidae from the Middle-Late Jurassic of Eurasia have frequently suggested to be avialans, but have also alternatively found as a separate lineage of paravians. [ 153 ] 
Skeleton of Heterodontosaurus , a primitive ornithischian from the Early Jurassic of South Africa 

# Ornithischians 
[ edit ] 

The earliest definitive ornithischians appear during the Early Jurassic, represented by basal ornithischians like Lesothosaurus , heterodontosaurids , and early members of Thyreophora . The earliest members of Ankylosauria and Stegosauria appear during the Middle Jurassic. [ 154 ] The basal neornithischian Kulindadromeus from the Middle Jurassic of Russia indicates that at least some ornithischians were covered in protofeathers . [ 155 ] The earliest members of Ankylopollexia , which become prominent in the Cretaceous, appeared during the Late Jurassic, represented by bipedal forms such as Camptosaurus . [ 156 ] Ceratopsians first appeared in the Late Jurassic of China, represented by members of Chaoyangsauridae . [ 157 ] 

# Sauropodomorphs 
[ edit ] 
Skeleton of Mamenchisaurus sinocanadorum from the Middle-Late Jurassic of China 

Sauropods became the dominant large herbivores in terrestrial ecosystems during the Jurassic. [ 158 ] Some Jurassic sauropods reached gigantic sizes, becoming the largest organisms to have ever lived on land. [ 159 ] 

Basal bipedal sauropodomorphs , such as massospondylids , continued to exist into the Early Jurassic, but became extinct by the beginning of the Middle Jurassic. [ 158 ] Quadrupedal sauropomorphs appeared during the Late Triassic. The quadrupedal Ledumahadi from the earliest Jurassic of South Africa reached an estimated weight of 12 tons, far in excess of other known basal sauropodomorphs. [ 160 ] Gravisaurian sauropods first appeared during the Early Jurassic, with the oldest definitive record being Vulcanodon from Zimbabwe, likely of Sinemurian age. [ 161 ] Eusauropods first appeared during the late Early Jurassic (Toarcian) and diversified during the Middle Jurassic; [ 158 ] these included cetiosaurids , turiasaurs , [ 162 ] and mamenchisaurs . [ 163 ] Neosauropods such as macronarians and diplodocoids first appeared during the Middle Jurassic, before becoming abundant and globally distributed during the Late Jurassic. [ 164 ] 

# Other reptiles 
[ edit ] 

# Crocodylomorphs 
[ edit ] 
Holotype specimen of Platysuchus , a telosaurid thalattosuchian 

The Triassic–Jurassic extinction decimated pseudosuchian diversity, with crocodylomorphs , which originated during the early Late Triassic, being the only group of pseudosuchians to survive. All other pseudosuchians, including the herbivorous aetosaurs and carnivorous " rauisuchians ", became extinct. [ 165 ] The morphological diversity of crocodylomorphs during the Early Jurassic was around the same as that of Late Triassic pseudosuchians, but they occupied different areas of morphospace, suggesting that they occupied different ecological niches to their Triassic counterparts and that there was an extensive and rapid radiation of crocodylomorphs during this interval. [ 166 ] While living crocodilians are mostly confined to an aquatic ambush predator lifestyle, Jurassic crocodylomorphs exhibited a wide variety of life habits. An unnamed protosuchid known from teeth from the Early Jurassic of Arizona represents the earliest known herbivorous crocodylomorph, an adaptation that appeared several times during the Mesozoic. [ 167 ] 

The Thalattosuchia , a clade of predominantly marine crocodylomorphs, first appeared during the Early Jurassic and became a prominent part of marine ecosystems. [ 168 ] Within Thalattosuchia, the Metriorhynchidae became highly adapted for life in the open ocean, including the transformation of limbs into flippers, the development of a tail fluke, and smooth, scaleless skin. [ 169 ] The morphological diversity of crocodylomorphs during the Early and Middle Jurassic was relatively low compared to that in later time periods and was dominated by terrestrial small-bodied, long-legged sphenosuchians , early crocodyliforms and thalattosuchians. [ 170 ] [ 168 ] The Neosuchia , a major group of crocodylomorphs, first appeared during the Early to Middle Jurassic. The Neosuchia represents the transition from an ancestrally terrestrial lifestyle to a freshwater aquatic ecology similar to that occupied by modern crocodilians. [ 171 ] The timing of the origin of Neosuchia is disputed. The oldest record of Neosuchians has been suggested to be Calsoyasuchus , from the Early Jurassic of Arizona, which in many analyses has been recovered as the earliest branching member of the neosuchian family Goniopholididae , which radically alters times of diversification for crocodylomorphs. However, this placement has been disputed, with some analyses finding it outside Neosuchia, which would place the oldest records of Neosuchia in the Middle Jurassic. [ 171 ] Razanandrongobe from the Middle Jurassic of Madagascar has been suggested to represent the oldest record of Notosuchia , a primarily Gondwanan clade of mostly terrestrial crocodylomorphs, otherwise known from the Cretaceous and Cenozoic. [ 172 ] 

# Turtles 
[ edit ] 
Thalassemys , a thalassochelydian sea turtle known from the Late Jurassic of Germany 

Stem-group turtles ( Testudinata ) diversified during the Jurassic. Jurassic stem-turtles belong to two progressively more advanced clades, the Mesochelydia and Perichelydia . [ 173 ] It is thought that the ancestral condition for mesochelydians is aquatic, as opposed to terrestrial for testudinates. [ 174 ] The two modern groups of turtles ( Testudines ), Pleurodira and Cryptodira , diverged by the beginning of the Late Jurassic. [ 173 ] The oldest known pleurodires, the Platychelyidae , are known from the Late Jurassic of Europe and the Americas, [ 175 ] while the oldest unambiguous cryptodire, Sinaspideretes , an early relative of softshell turtles , is known from the Late Jurassic of China. [ 176 ] The Thalassochelydia , a diverse lineage of marine turtles unrelated to modern sea turtles , are known from the Late Jurassic of Europe and South America. [ 177 ] 

# Lepidosaurs 
[ edit ] 

Rhynchocephalians (the sole living representative being the tuatara ) had achieved a global distribution by the beginning of the Jurassic, [ 178 ] and represented the dominant group of small reptiles during the Jurassic globally. [ 179 ] Rhynchocephalians reached their highest morphological diversity in their evolutionary history during the Jurassic, occupying a wide range of lifestyles, including the aquatic pleurosaurs with long snake-like bodies and reduced limbs, the specialized herbivorous eilenodontines , as well as the sapheosaurs which had broad tooth plates indicative of durophagy . [ 180 ] Rhynchocephalians disappeared from Asia after the Early Jurassic. [ 178 ] The last common ancestor of living squamates (which includes lizards and snakes ) is estimated to have lived around 190 million years ago during the Early Jurassic, with the major divergences between modern squamate lineages estimated to have occurred during the Early to Middle Jurassic. [ 181 ] Squamates first appear in the fossil record during the Middle Jurassic [ 182 ] including members of modern clades such as Scincomorpha , [ 183 ] though many Jurassic squamates have unclear relationships to living groups. [ 184 ] Eichstaettisaurus from the Late Jurassic of Germany has been suggested to be an early relative of geckos and displays adaptations for climbing. [ 185 ] Dorsetisaurus from the Late Jurassic of North America and Europe represents the oldest widely accepted record of Anguimorpha . [ 186 ] Marmoretta from the Middle Jurassic of Britain has been suggested to represent a late surviving lepidosauromorph outside both Rhynchocephalia and Squamata, though some studies have recovered it as a stem-squamate. [ 187 ]

# Choristoderes 
[ edit ] 
Skeleton of Coeruleodraco 

The earliest known remains of Choristodera , a group of freshwater aquatic reptiles with uncertain affinities to other reptile groups, are found in the Middle Jurassic. Only two genera of choristodere are known from the Jurassic. One is the small lizard-like Cteniogenys , thought to be the most basal known choristodere; it is known from the Middle to Late Jurassic of Europe and Late Jurassic of North America, with similar remains also known from the upper Middle Jurassic of Kyrgyzstan and western Siberia. [ 188 ] The other is Coeruleodraco from the Late Jurassic of China, which is a more advanced choristodere, though still small and lizard-like in morphology. [ 189 ] 

# Ichthyosaurs 
[ edit ] 
Fossil of Ichthyosaurus somersetensis at the Natural History Museum, London 

Ichthyosaurs suffered an evolutionary bottleneck during the end-Triassic extinction, with all non- neoichthyosaurians becoming extinct. Ichthyosaurs reached their apex of species diversity during the Early Jurassic, with an array of morphologies including the huge apex predator Temnodontosaurus and swordfish-like Eurhinosaurus , though Early Jurassic ichthyosaurs were significantly less morphologically diverse than their Triassic counterparts. [ 190 ] [ 191 ] At the Early–Middle Jurassic boundary, between the end of the Toarcian and the beginning of the Bajocian, most lineages of ichythosaur appear to have become extinct, with the first appearance of the Ophthalmosauridae , the clade that would encompass almost all ichthyosaurs from then on, during the early Bajocian. [ 192 ] Ophthalmosaurids were diverse by the Late Jurassic, but failed to fill many of the niches that had been occupied by ichthyosaurs during the Early Jurassic. [ 192 ] [ 190 ] [ 191 ] 

# Plesiosaurs 
[ edit ] 
Rhomaleosaurus cramptoni at the Natural History Museum, London 

Plesiosaurs originated at the end of the Triassic (Rhaetian). By the end of the Triassic, all other sauropterygians , including placodonts and nothosaurs , had become extinct. At least six lineages of plesiosaur crossed the Triassic–Jurassic boundary. [ 193 ] Plesiosaurs were already diverse in the earliest Jurassic, with the majority of plesiosaurs in the Hettangian-aged Blue Lias belonging to the Rhomaleosauridae . Early plesiosaurs were generally small-bodied, with body size increasing into the Toarcian. [ 194 ] There appears to have been a strong turnover around the Early–Middle Jurassic boundary, with microcleidids and rhomaleosaurids becoming extinct and nearly extinct respectively after the end of the Toarcian with the first appearance of the dominant clade of plesiosaurs of the latter half of the Jurassic, the Cryptoclididae during the Bajocian. [ 192 ] The Middle Jurassic saw the evolution of short-necked and large-headed thalassophonean pliosaurs from ancestrally small-headed, long-necked forms . [ 195 ] [ 192 ] Some thalassophonean pliosaurs, such as some species of Pliosaurus , had skulls up to two metres in length with body lengths estimated around 10–12 meters (33–39 ft), making them the apex predators of Late Jurassic oceans. [ 196 ] [ 192 ] Plesiosaurs invaded freshwater environments during the Jurassic, with indeterminate remains of small-bodied pleisosaurs known from freshwater sediments from the Jurassic of China and Australia. [ 197 ] [ 198 ] 

# Pterosaurs 
[ edit ] 
Skeleton of Rhamphorhynchus muensteri at Teylers Museum , Haarlem 

Pterosaurs first appeared in the Late Triassic. A major radiation of Jurassic pterosaurs is the Rhamphorhynchidae , which first appeared in the late Early Jurassic (Toarcian); [ 199 ] they are thought to been piscivorous . [ 200 ] Anurognathids , which first appeared in the Middle Jurassic, possessed short heads and densely furred bodies, and are thought to have been insectivores. [ 200 ] Derived monofenestratan pterosaurs such as wukongopterids appeared in the late Middle Jurassic. Advanced short-tailed pterodactyloids first appeared at the Middle–Late Jurassic boundary. Jurassic pterodactyloids include the ctenochasmatids , like Ctenochasma , which have closely spaced needle-like teeth that were presumably used for filter feeding . [ 200 ] The bizarre Late Jurassic ctenochasmatoid Cycnorhamphus had a jaw with teeth only at the tips, with bent jaws like those of living openbill storks that may have been used to hold and crush hard invertebrates. [ 200 ] 

# Amphibians 
[ edit ] 
Skeleton of Karaurus sharovi , a stem-group salamander from the Middle to Late Jurassic of Kazakhstan 

The diversity of temnospondyls had progressively declined through the Late Triassic, with only brachyopoids surviving into the Jurassic and beyond. [ 201 ] Members of the family Brachyopidae are known from Jurassic deposits in Asia, [ 202 ] while the chigutisaurid Siderops is known from the Early Jurassic of Australia. [ 203 ] Modern lissamphibians began to diversify during the Jurassic. The Early Jurassic Prosalirus thought to represent the first frog relative with a morphology capable of hopping like living frogs. [ 204 ] Morphologically recognisable stem-frogs like the South American Notobatrachus are known from the Middle Jurassic, [ 205 ] with modern crown-group frogs like Enneabatrachus and Rhadinosteus appearing by the Late Jurassic. [ 206 ] While the earliest salamander-line amphibians are known from the Triassic, [ 207 ] crown group salamanders first appear during the Middle to Late Jurassic in Eurasia, alongside stem-group relatives. Many Jurassic stem-group salamanders, such as Marmorerpeton and Kokartus , are thought to have been neotenic . [ 208 ] Early representatives of crown group salamanders include Chunerpeton , Pangerpeton and Linglongtriton from the Middle to Late Jurassic Yanliao Biota of China. Some of these are suggested to belong to Cryptobranchoidea , which contains living Asiatic and giant salamanders . [ 209 ] Beiyanerpeton , and Qinglongtriton from the same biota are thought to be early members of Salamandroidea , the group which contains all other living salamanders. [ 210 ] [ 211 ] Salamanders dispersed into North America by the end of the Jurassic, as evidenced by Iridotriton , found in the Late Jurassic Morrison Formation . [ 212 ] The stem- caecilian Eocaecilia is known from the Early Jurassic of Arizona. [ 213 ] The fourth group of lissamphibians, the extinct salamander-like albanerpetontids , first appeared in the Middle Jurassic, represented by Anoualerpeton priscus from the Bathonian of Britain, as well as indeterminate remains from equivalently aged sediments in France and the Anoual Formation of Morocco. [ 214 ] 
Henkelotherium , a likely arboreal dyolestoid from the Late Jurassic of Portugal 

# Mammaliaformes 
[ edit ] 

Mammaliaformes , including mammals , having originated from cynodonts at the end of the Triassic, diversified extensively during the Jurassic. [ 215 ] While most Jurassic mammalaliaforms are solely known from isolated teeth and jaw fragments, exceptionally preserved remains have revealed a variety of lifestyles. [ 215 ] The docodontan Castorocauda was adapted to aquatic life, similarly to the platypus and otters . [ 216 ] Some members of Haramiyida [ 217 ] and the eutriconodontan tribe Volaticotherini [ 218 ] had a patagium akin to those of flying squirrels , allowing them to glide through the air. The aardvark -like mammal Fruitafossor , of uncertain taxonomy, was likely a specialist on colonial insects, similarly to living anteaters . [ 219 ] Australosphenida , a group of mammals possibly related to living monotremes , first appeared in the Middle Jurassic of Gondwana. [ 220 ] The earliest records of multituberculates , one of the longest lasting and most successful orders of mammals, are known from the Middle Jurassic. [ 221 ] Therian mammals, represented today by living placentals and marsupials , diversified meteorically during the Middle Jurassic. [ 222 ] They have their earliest records during the early Late Jurassic, represented by Juramaia , a eutherian mammal closer to the ancestry of placentals than marsupials. [ 223 ] Juramaia is much more advanced than expected for its age, as other therian mammals are not known until the Early Cretaceous, and it has been suggested that Juramaia may also originate from the Early Cretaceous instead. [ 224 ] Two groups of non-mammaliaform cynodonts persisted beyond the end of the Triassic. The insectiviorous Tritheledontidae has a few records from the Early Jurassic. The Tritylodontidae , a herbiviorous group of cynodonts that first appeared during the Rhaetian, has abundant records from the Jurassic, overwhelmingly from the Northern Hemisphere. [ 225 ] [ 226 ] 

# Fish

# Jawless fish 
[ edit ] 
Fossils and life restorations of the two species of Yanliaomyzon , a lamprey known from the Middle Jurassic of China 

The last known species of conodont , a class of jawless fish whose hard, tooth-like elements are key index fossils, finally became extinct during the earliest Jurassic after over 300 million years of evolutionary history, with an asynchronous extinction occurring first in the Tethys and eastern Panthalassa and survivors persisting into the earliest Hettangian of Hungary and central Panthalassa. [ 227 ] End-Triassic conodonts were represented by only a handful of species and had been progressively declining through the Middle and Late Triassic. [ 228 ] Yanliaomyzon from the Middle Jurassic of China represents the oldest post Paleozoic lamprey , and the oldest lamprey to have the toothed feeding apparatus and likely the three stage life cycle typical of modern members of the group. [ 229 ] 

# Sarcopterygii 
[ edit ] 
Coelacanth from the Solnhofen Limestone 

Lungfish (Dipnoi) were present in freshwater environments of both hemispheres during the Jurassic. [ 230 ] Some studies have proposed that the last common ancestor of all living lungfish lived during the Jurassic. [ 231 ] Mawsoniids , a marine and freshwater/brackish group of coelacanths , which first appeared in North America during the Triassic, expanded into Europe and South America by the end of the Jurassic. [ 232 ] The marine Latimeriidae , which contains the living coelacanths of the genus Latimeria , were also present in the Jurassic, having originated in the Triassic, with a number of records from the Jurassic of Europe including Swenzia , thought to be the closest known relative of living coelacanths. [ 233 ] 

# Actinopterygii 
[ edit ] 
Fossil of Thrissops , an ichthyodectid stem-group teleost from the Late Jurassic Solnhofen Limestone of Germany, showing preserved colouration 

Ray-finned fish ( Actinopterygii ) were major components of Jurassic freshwater and marine ecosystems. Archaic " palaeoniscoid " fish, which were common in both marine and freshwater habitats during the preceding Triassic declined during the Jurassic, being largely replaced by more derived actinopterygian lineages. [ 234 ] The oldest known Acipenseriformes , the group that contains living sturgeon and paddlefish , are from the Early Jurassic. [ 235 ] Amiiform fish (which today only includes the bowfin ) first appeared during the Early Jurassic, represented by Caturus from the Pliensbachian of Britain; after their appearance in the western Tethys, they expanded to Africa, North America and Southeast and East Asia by the end of the Jurassic, [ 236 ] with the modern family Amiidae appearing during the Late Jurassic. [ 237 ] Pycnodontiformes , which first appeared in the western Tethys during the Late Triassic, expanded to South America and Southeast Asia by the end of the Jurassic, having a high diversity in Europe during the Late Jurassic. [ 236 ] During the Jurassic, the Ginglymodi , the only living representatives being gars (Lepisosteidae) were diverse in both freshwater and marine environments. The oldest known representatives of anatomically modern gars appeared during the Late Jurassic. [ 238 ] Stem-group teleosts , which make up over 99% of living Actinopterygii, had first appeared during the Triassic in the western Tethys; they underwent a major diversification beginning in the Late Jurassic, with early representatives of modern teleost clades such as Elopomorpha and Osteoglossoidei appearing during this time. [ 239 ] [ 240 ] The Pachycormiformes , a group of marine stem-teleosts, first appeared in the Early Jurassic and included both tuna -like predatory and filter-feeding forms, the latter included the largest bony fish known to have existed: Leedsichthys , with an estimated maximum length of over 15 metres, known from the late Middle to Late Jurassic.

During the Early Jurassic, the shark-like hybodonts , which represented the dominant group of chondrichthyans during the preceding Triassic, were common in both marine and freshwater settings; however, by the Late Jurassic, hybodonts had become minor components of most marine communities, having been largely replaced by modern neoselachians , but remained common in freshwater and restricted marine environments. [ 242 ] [ 243 ] The Neoselachii, which contains all living sharks and rays, radiated beginning in the Early Jurassic. [ 244 ] The oldest known ray ( Batoidea ) is Antiquaobatis from the Pliensbachian of Germany. [ 245 ] Jurassic batoids known from complete remains retain a conservative, guitarfish -like morphology. [ 246 ] The oldest known Hexanchiformes and carpet sharks (Orectolobiformes) are from the Early Jurassic (Pliensbachian and Toarcian, respectively) of Europe. [ 247 ] [ 248 ] The oldest known members of the Heterodontiformes , the only living members of which are the bullhead shark ( Heterodontus ), first appeared in the Early Jurassic, with representatives of the living genus appearing during the Late Jurassic. [ 249 ] The oldest record of angelsharks ( Squatiniformes ) is Pseudorhina from the Late Jurassic (Oxfordian–Tithonian) of Europe, which already has a bodyform similar to members of the only living genus of the order, Squatina . [ 250 ] The oldest known remains of Carcharhiniformes , the largest order of living sharks, first appear in the late Middle Jurassic (Bathonian) of the western Tethys (England and Morocco). Known dental and exceptionally preserved body remains of Jurassic Carchariniformes are similar to those of living catsharks . [ 251 ] Synechodontiformes , an extinct group of sharks closely related to Neoselachii, were also widespread during the Jurassic. [ 252 ] The oldest remains of modern chimaeras are from the Early Jurassic of Europe, with members of the living family Callorhinchidae appearing during the Middle Jurassic. Unlike most living chimaeras, Jurassic chimeras are often found in shallow water environments. [ 253 ] The closely related myriacanthids and the flattened Squaloraja are also known from the Jurassic of Europe. [ 254 ] 

# Insects and arachnids 
[ edit ] 
Lichnomesopsyche daohugouensis , an extinct mesopsychid scorpionfly from the Late Jurassic of China 

There appears to have been no major extinction of insects at the Triassic–Jurassic boundary. [ 83 ] Many important insect fossil localities are known from the Jurassic of Eurasia, the most important being the Karabastau Formation of Kazakhstan and the various Yanliao Biota deposits in Inner Mongolia, China, such as the Daohugou Bed, dating to the Callovian–Oxfordian. The diversity of insects stagnated throughout the Early and Middle Jurassic, but during the latter third of the Jurassic origination rates increased substantially while extinction rates remained flat. [ 255 ] The increasing diversity of insects in the Middle–Late Jurassic corresponds with a substantial increase in the diversity of insect mouthparts . [ 256 ] The Middle to Late Jurassic was a time of major diversification for beetles , [ 257 ] particularly for the suborder Polyphaga , which represents 90% of living beetle species but which was rare during the preceding Triassic. [ 258 ] Weevils first appear in the fossil record during the Middle to Late Jurassic, but are suspected to have originated during the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic. [ 259 ] Orthopteran diversity had declined during the Late Triassic, but recovered during the Early Jurassic, [ 260 ] with the Hagloidea , a superfamily of ensiferan orthopterans today confined to a few living species, being particularly diverse during the Jurassic. [ 261 ] The oldest known lepidopterans (the group containing butterflies and moths) are known from the Triassic–Jurassic boundary, with wing scales belonging to the suborder Glossata and Micropterigidae -grade moths from the deposits of this age in Germany. [ 262 ] Modern representatives of both dragonflies and damselflies also first appeared during the Jurassic. [ 263 ] Although modern representatives are not known until the Cenozoic, ectoparasitic insects thought to represent primitive fleas , belonging to the family Pseudopulicidae , are known from the Middle Jurassic of Asia. These insects are substantially different from modern fleas, lacking the specialised morphology of the latter and being larger. [ 264 ] [ 265 ] Parasitoid wasps ( Apocrita ) first appeared during the Early Jurassic and subsequently became widespread, reshaping terrestrial food webs. [ 266 ] The Jurassic saw also saw the first appearances of several other groups of insects, including Phasmatodea (stick insects), [ 267 ] Mantophasmatidae (gladiators), [ 268 ] Embioptera (webspinners), [ 269 ] and Raphidioptera (snakeflies). [ 270 ] The earliest scale insect (Coccomorpha) is known from amber dating to the Late Jurassic, though the group probably originated earlier during the Triassic. [ 271 ] 
Mongolarachne from the Late Jurassic of China 

Only a handful of records of mites are known from the Jurassic, including Jureremus , an oribatid mite belonging to the family Cymbaeremaeidae known from the Late Jurassic of Britain and Russia, [ 272 ] and a member of the still living orbatid genus Hydrozetes from the Early Jurassic of Sweden. [ 273 ] Spiders diversified through the Jurassic. [ 274 ] The Early Jurassic Seppo koponeni may represent a stem group to Palpimanoidea . [ 275 ] Eoplectreurys from the Middle Jurassic of China is considered a stem lineage of Synspermiata . The oldest member of the family Archaeidae , Patarchaea , is known from the Middle Jurassic of China. [ 274 ] Mongolarachne from the Middle Jurassic of China is among the largest known fossil spiders, with legs over 5 centimetres long. [ 276 ] The only scorpion known from the Jurassic is Liassoscorpionides from the Early Jurassic of Germany, of uncertain placement. [ 277 ] Eupnoi harvestmen ( Opiliones ) are known from the Middle Jurassic of China, including members of the family Sclerosomatidae . [ 278 ] [ 279 ] 

# Marine invertebrates

# End-Triassic extinction 
[ edit ] 

During the end-Triassic extinction, 46%–72% of all marine genera became extinct. The effects of the end Triassic extinction were greatest at tropical latitudes and were more severe in Panthalassa than the Tethys or Boreal oceans. Tropical reef ecosystems collapsed during the event, and would not fully recover until much later in the Jurassic. Sessile filter feeders and photosymbiotic organisms were among those most severely affected. [ 280 ] 

# Marine ecosystems 
[ edit ] 

Having declined at the Triassic–Jurassic boundary, reefs substantially expanded during the Late Jurassic, including both sponge reefs and scleractinian coral reefs . Late Jurassic reefs were similar in form to modern reefs but had more microbial carbonates and hypercalcified sponges , and had weak biogenic binding. Reefs sharply declined at the close of the Jurassic, [ 281 ] which caused an associated drop in diversity in decapod crustaceans. [ 282 ] The earliest planktonic foraminifera, which constitute the suborder Globigerinina , are known from the late Early Jurassic (mid-Toarcian) of the western Tethys, expanding across the whole Tethys by the Middle Jurassic and becoming globally distributed in tropical latitudes by the Late Jurassic. [ 283 ] Coccolithophores and dinoflagellates , which had first appeared during the Triassic, radiated during the Early to Middle Jurassic, becoming prominent members of the phytoplankton . [ 284 ] Microconchid tube worms, the last remaining order of Tentaculita , a group of animals of uncertain affinities that were convergent on Spirorbis tube worms, were rare after the Triassic and had become reduced to the single genus Punctaconchus , which became extinct in the late Bathonian. [ 285 ] The oldest known diatom is from Late Jurassic–aged amber from Thailand, assigned to the living genus Hemiaulus . [ 286 ] 

# Echinoderms 
[ edit ] 

Crinoids diversified throughout the Jurassic, reaching their peak Mesozoic diversity during the Late Jurassic, primarily due to the radiation of sessile forms belonging to the orders Cyrtocrinida and Millericrinida . [ 287 ] Echinoids (sea urchins) underwent substantial diversification beginning in the Early Jurassic, primarily driven by the radiation of irregular (asymmetrical) forms, which were adapting to deposit feeding. Rates of diversification sharply dropped during the Late Jurassic. [ 288 ] 

# Crustaceans 
[ edit ] 
Eryon , a polychelidan decapod crustacean from the Late Jurassic of Germany. 

The Jurassic was a significant time for the evolution of decapods . [ 282 ] The first true crabs ( Brachyura ) are known from the Early Jurassic, with the earliest being Eocarcinus praecursor from the early Pliensbachian of England, which lacked the crab-like morphology ( carcinisation ) of modern crabs, [ 289 ] and Eoprosopon klugi from the late Pliensbachian of Germany, which may belong to the living family Homolodromiidae . [ 290 ] Most Jurassic crabs are known only from carapace pieces, which makes it difficult to determine their relationships. [ 291 ] While rare in the Early and Middle Jurassic, crabs became abundant during the Late Jurassic as they expanded from their ancestral silty sea floor habitat into hard substrate habitats like reefs, with crevices in reefs providing refuge from predators. [ 291 ] [ 282 ] Hermit crabs also first appeared during the Jurassic, with the earliest known being Schobertella hoelderi from the late Hettangian of Germany. [ 292 ] Early hermit crabs are associated with ammonite shells rather than those of gastropods. [ 293 ] Glypheids , which today are only known from two species, reached their peak diversity during the Jurassic, with around 150 species out of a total fossil record of 250 known from the period. [ 294 ] Jurassic barnacles were of low diversity compared to present, [ 295 ] but several important evolutionary innovations are known, including the first appearances of calcite shelled forms and species with an epiplanktonic mode of life. [ 296 ] 

# Brachiopods 
[ edit ] 

Brachiopod diversity declined during the Triassic–Jurassic extinction. Spire-bearing brachiopods ( Spiriferinida and Athyridida ) did not recover their biodiversity, becoming extinct in the TOAE. [ 297 ] Rhynchonellida and Terebratulida also declined during the Triassic–Jurassic extinction but rebounded during the Early Jurassic; neither clade underwent much morphological variation. [ 298 ] Brachiopods substantially declined in the Late Jurassic; the causes are poorly understood. Proposed reasons include increased predation, competition with bivalves, enhanced bioturbation or increased grazing pressure . [ 299 ] 

# Bryozoans 
[ edit ] 

Like the preceding Triassic, bryozoan diversity was relatively low compared to the Paleozoic. The vast majority of Jurassic bryozoans are members of Cyclostomatida , which experienced a radiation during the Middle Jurassic, with all Jurassic representatives belonging to the suborders Tubuliporina and Cerioporina . Cheilostomata , the dominant group of modern bryozoans, first appeared during the Late Jurassic. [ 300 ] 

# Molluscs 
[ edit ] 

# Gastropods 
[ edit ] 

Marine gastropods were significantly affected by the T-J extinction, with around 56% of genera going extinct, with Neritimorpha being particularly strongly effected, while Heterobranchia suffered much lower losses than other groups. [ 301 ] While present, the diversity of freshwater and land snails was much lower during the Jurassic than in contemporary ecosystems, with the diversity of these groups not reaching levels comparable to modern times until the following Cretaceous. [ 302 ] 

# Bivalves 
[ edit ] 

The end-Triassic extinction had a severe impact on bivalve diversity, though it had little impact on bivalve ecological diversity. The extinction was selective, having less of an impact on deep burrowers, but there is no evidence of a differential impact between surface-living (epifaunal) and burrowing (infaunal) bivalves. [ 303 ] Bivalve family level diversity after the Early Jurassic was static, though genus diversity experienced a gradual increase throughout the period. [ 304 ] Rudists , the dominant reef-building organisms of the Cretaceous, first appeared in the Late Jurassic (mid-Oxfordian) in the northern margin of the western Tethys, expanding to the eastern Tethys by the end of the Jurassic. [ 305 ] 

# Cephalopods 
[ edit ] 
Fossil specimen of Proteroctopus from the Middle Jurassic of France, formerly thought to be world's oldest known octopus 

Ammonites were devastated by the end-Triassic extinction, with only a handful of genera belonging to the family Psiloceratidae of the suborder Phylloceratina surviving and becoming ancestral to all later Jurassic and Cretaceous ammonites. Ammonites explosively diversified during the Early Jurassic, with the orders Psiloceratina , Ammonitina , Lytoceratina , Haploceratina , Perisphinctina and Ancyloceratina all appearing during the Jurassic. Ammonite faunas during the Jurassic were regional, being divided into around 20 distinguishable provinces and subprovinces in two realms, the northern high latitude Pan-Boreal realm, consisting of the Arctic, northern Panthalassa and northern Atlantic regions, and the equatorial–southern Pan-Tethyan realm, which included the Tethys and most of Panthalassa. [ 306 ] Ammonite diversifications occurred coevally with marine transgressions , while their diversity nadirs occurred during marine regressions . [ 307 ] 

The oldest definitive records of the squid-like belemnites are from the earliest Jurassic (Hettangian–Sinemurian) of Europe and Japan; they expanded worldwide during the Jurassic. [ 308 ] Belemnites were shallow-water dwellers, inhabiting the upper 200 metres of the water column on the continental shelves and in the littoral zone . They were key components of Jurassic ecosystems, both as predators and prey, as evidenced by the abundance of belemnite guards in Jurassic rocks. [ 309 ] 

The earliest vampyromorphs , of which the only living member is the vampire squid , first appeared during the Early Jurassic. [ 310 ] The earliest octopuses appeared during the Middle Jurassic, having split from their closest living relatives, the vampyromorphs, during the Triassic to Early Jurassic. [ 311 ] All Jurassic octopuses are solely known from the hard gladius . [ 311 ] [ 312 ] Octopuses likely originated from bottom-dwelling ( benthic ) ancestors which lived in shallow environments. [ 311 ] Proteroctopus from the late Middle Jurassic La Voulte-sur-Rhône lagerstätte , previously interpreted as an early octopus, is now thought to be a basal taxon outside the clade containing vampyromorphs and octopuses. [ 313 ]

The Cretaceous ( IPA : / k r ɪ ˈ t eɪ ʃ ə s / krih- TAY -shəss ) [ 2 ] is a geologic period that lasted from about 143.1 to 66 Ma (million years ago). It is the third and final period of the Mesozoic Era , as well as the longest. At around 77.1 million years, it is the ninth and longest geological period of the entire Phanerozoic . The name is derived from the Latin creta , ' chalk ', which is abundant in the latter half of the period. It is usually abbreviated K , for its German translation Kreide . 

The Cretaceous was a period with a relatively warm climate , resulting in high eustatic sea levels that created numerous shallow inland seas . These oceans and seas were populated with now- extinct marine reptiles , ammonites , and rudists , while dinosaurs continued to dominate on land. The world was largely ice-free, although there is some evidence of brief periods of glaciation during the cooler first half, and forests extended to the poles. 

Many of the dominant taxonomic groups present in modern times can be ultimately traced back to origins in the Cretaceous. During this time, new groups of mammals and birds appeared, including the earliest relatives of placentals and marsupials ( Eutheria and Metatheria respectively), with the earliest crown group birds appearing towards the end of the Cretaceous. Teleost fish, the most diverse group of modern vertebrates, continued to diversify during the Cretaceous with the appearance of their most diverse subgroup Acanthomorpha during this period. During the Early Cretaceous, flowering plants appeared and began to rapidly diversify, becoming the dominant group of plants across the Earth by the end of the Cretaceous, coincident with the decline and extinction of previously widespread gymnosperm groups. 

The Cretaceous (along with the Mesozoic) ended with the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event , a large mass extinction in which many groups, including non-avian dinosaurs, pterosaurs , and large marine reptiles , died out, widely thought to have been caused by the impact of a large asteroid that formed the Chicxulub crater in the Gulf of Mexico. The end of the Cretaceous is defined by the abrupt Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (K–Pg boundary), a geologic signature associated with the mass extinction that lies between the Mesozoic and Cenozoic Eras . 

# Etymology and history 
[ edit ] 

The Cretaceous as a separate period was first defined by Belgian geologist Jean d'Omalius d'Halloy in 1822 as the Terrain Crétacé , [ 3 ] using strata in the Paris Basin [ 4 ] and named for the extensive beds of chalk ( calcium carbonate deposited by the shells of marine invertebrates , principally coccoliths ), found in the upper Cretaceous of Western Europe . The name Cretaceous was derived from the Latin creta , meaning chalk . [ 5 ] The twofold division of the Cretaceous was implemented by Conybeare and Phillips in 1822. Alcide d'Orbigny in 1840 divided the French Cretaceous into five étages (stages): the Neocomian , Aptian, Albian, Turonian, and Senonian, later adding the Urgonian between Neocomian and Aptian and the Cenomanian between the Albian and Turonian. [ 6 ]

# Subdivisions 
[ edit ] 

The Cretaceous is divided into Early and Late Cretaceous epochs , or Lower and Upper Cretaceous series . In older literature, the Cretaceous is sometimes divided into three series: Neocomian (lower/early), Gallic (middle) and Senonian (upper/late). A subdivision into 12 stages , all originating from European stratigraphy, is now used worldwide. In many parts of the world, alternative local subdivisions are still in use. 

From youngest to oldest, the subdivisions of the Cretaceous Period are: [ 7 ]

# Boundaries 
[ edit ] 
The impact of a meteorite or comet is today widely accepted as the main reason for the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event . 

See also: Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 

The lower boundary of the Cretaceous is currently undefined, and the Jurassic–Cretaceous boundary is currently the only system boundary to lack a defined Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP). Placing a GSSP for this boundary has been difficult because of the strong regionality of most biostratigraphic markers, and the lack of any chemostratigraphic events, such as isotope excursions (large sudden changes in ratios of isotopes ) that could be used to define or correlate a boundary. Calpionellids , an enigmatic group of planktonic protists with urn-shaped calcitic tests briefly abundant during the latest Jurassic to earliest Cretaceous, have been suggested as the most promising candidates for fixing the Jurassic–Cretaceous boundary. [ 8 ] In particular, the first appearance Calpionella alpina , coinciding with the base of the eponymous Alpina subzone, has been proposed as the definition of the base of the Cretaceous. [ 9 ] The working definition for the boundary has often been placed as the first appearance of the ammonite Strambergella jacobi , formerly placed in the genus Berriasella , but its use as a stratigraphic indicator has been questioned, as its first appearance does not correlate with that of C. alpina . [ 10 ] The boundary is officially considered by the International Commission on Stratigraphy to be approximately 145 Ma, [ 11 ] but other estimates have been proposed based on U-Pb geochronology, ranging as young as 140 Ma. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] 

The upper boundary of the Cretaceous is sharply defined, being placed at an iridium -rich layer found worldwide that is believed to be associated with the Chicxulub impact crater , with its boundaries circumscribing parts of the Yucatán Peninsula and extending into the Gulf of Mexico . This layer has been dated at 66.043 Ma. [ 14 ] 

At the end of the Cretaceous, the impact of a large body with the Earth may have been the punctuation mark at the end of a progressive decline in biodiversity during the Maastrichtian age. The result was the extinction of three-quarters of Earth's plant and animal species. The impact created the sharp break known as the K–Pg boundary (formerly known as the K–T boundary). Earth's biodiversity required substantial time to recover from this event, despite the probable existence of an abundance of vacant ecological niches . [ 15 ] 

Despite the severity of the K-Pg extinction event, there were significant variations in the rate of extinction between and within different clades . Species that depended on photosynthesis declined or became extinct as atmospheric particles blocked solar energy . As is the case today, photosynthesizing organisms, such as phytoplankton and land plants , formed the primary part of the food chain in the late Cretaceous, and all else that depended on them suffered, as well. Herbivorous animals, which depended on plants and plankton as their food, died out as their food sources became scarce; consequently, the top predators , such as Tyrannosaurus rex , also perished. [ 16 ] Yet only three major groups of tetrapods disappeared completely; the non-avian dinosaurs , the plesiosaurs and the pterosaurs . The other Cretaceous groups that did not survive into the Cenozoic Era — the ichthyosaurs , last remaining temnospondyls ( Koolasuchus ), and nonmammalian cynodonts ( Tritylodontidae ) — were already extinct millions of years before the event occurred. [ citation needed ] 

Coccolithophorids and molluscs , including ammonites , rudists , freshwater snails , and mussels , as well as organisms whose food chain included these shell builders, became extinct or suffered heavy losses. For example, ammonites are thought to have been the principal food of mosasaurs , a group of giant marine lizards related to snakes that became extinct at the boundary. [ 17 ] 

Omnivores , insectivores , and carrion -eaters survived the extinction event, perhaps because of the increased availability of their food sources. At the end of the Cretaceous, there seem to have been no purely herbivorous or carnivorous mammals . Mammals and birds that survived the extinction fed on insects , larvae , worms , and snails, which in turn fed on dead plant and animal matter. Scientists theorise that these organisms survived the collapse of plant-based food chains because they fed on detritus . [ 18 ] [ 15 ] [ 19 ] 

In stream communities , few groups of animals became extinct. Stream communities rely less on food from living plants and more on detritus that washes in from land. This particular ecological niche buffered them from extinction. [ 20 ] Similar, but more complex patterns have been found in the oceans. Extinction was more severe among animals living in the water column than among animals living on or in the seafloor. Animals in the water column are almost entirely dependent on primary production from living phytoplankton, while animals living on or in the ocean floor feed on detritus or can switch to detritus feeding. [ 15 ] 

The largest air-breathing survivors of the event, crocodilians and champsosaurs , were semiaquatic and had access to detritus. Modern crocodilians can live as scavengers and can survive for months without food and go into hibernation when conditions are unfavorable, and their young are small, grow slowly, and feed largely on invertebrates and dead organisms or fragments of organisms for their first few years. These characteristics have been linked to crocodilian survival at the end of the Cretaceous. [ 18 ] 

# Geologic formations

Drawing of fossil jaws of Mosasaurus hoffmanni , from the Maastrichtian of Dutch Limburg , by Dutch geologist Pieter Harting (1866) Scipionyx , a theropod dinosaur from the Early Cretaceous of Italy 

The high sea level and warm climate of the Cretaceous meant large areas of the continents were covered by warm, shallow seas, providing habitat for many marine organisms. The Cretaceous was named for the extensive chalk deposits of this age in Europe, but in many parts of the world, the deposits from the Cretaceous are of marine limestone , a rock type that is formed under warm, shallow marine conditions. Due to the high sea level, there was extensive space for such sedimentation . Because of the relatively young age and great thickness of the system, Cretaceous rocks are evident in many areas worldwide. 

Chalk is a rock type characteristic for (but not restricted to) the Cretaceous. It consists of coccoliths , microscopically small calcite skeletons of coccolithophores , a type of algae that prospered in the Cretaceous seas. 

Stagnation of deep-sea currents in middle Cretaceous times caused anoxic conditions in the sea water leaving the deposited organic matter undecomposed. Half of the world's petroleum reserves were laid down at this time in the anoxic conditions of what would become the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Mexico. In many places around the world, dark anoxic shales were formed during this interval, [ 21 ] such as the Mancos Shale of western North America. [ 22 ] These shales are an important source rock for oil and gas , for example in the subsurface of the North Sea. 

# Europe 
[ edit ] 

See also: Category:Cretaceous System of Europe 

In northwestern Europe, chalk deposits from the Upper Cretaceous are characteristic for the Chalk Group , which forms the white cliffs of Dover on the south coast of England and similar cliffs on the French Normandian coast. The group is found in England, northern France, the Low Countries , northern Germany , Denmark and in the subsurface of the southern part of the North Sea . Chalk is not easily consolidated and the Chalk Group still consists of loose sediments in many places. The group also has other limestones and arenites . Among the fossils it contains are sea urchins , belemnites , ammonites and sea reptiles such as Mosasaurus . 

In southern Europe, the Cretaceous is usually a marine system consisting of competent limestone beds or incompetent marls . Because the Alpine mountain chains did not yet exist in the Cretaceous, these deposits formed on the southern edge of the European continental shelf , at the margin of the Tethys Ocean . 

# North America

Map of North America During the Late Cretaceous 

During the Cretaceous, the present North American continent was isolated from the other continents. In the Jurassic, the North Atlantic already opened, leaving a proto-ocean between Europe and North America. From north to south across the continent, the Western Interior Seaway started forming. This inland sea separated the elevated areas of Laramidia in the west and Appalachia in the east. Three dinosaur clades found in Laramidia (troodontids, therizinosaurids and oviraptorosaurs) are absent from Appalachia from the Coniacian through the Maastrichtian. [ 23 ] 

# Paleogeography 
[ edit ] 

During the Cretaceous, the late- Paleozoic -to-early-Mesozoic supercontinent of Pangaea completed its tectonic breakup into the present-day continents , although their positions were substantially different at the time. As the Atlantic Ocean widened, the convergent-margin mountain building ( orogenies ) that had begun during the Jurassic continued in the North American Cordillera , as the Nevadan orogeny was followed by the Sevier and Laramide orogenies . 

Gondwana had begun to break up during the Jurassic Period, but its fragmentation accelerated during the Cretaceous and was largely complete by the end of the period. South America , Antarctica , and Australia rifted away from Africa (though India and Madagascar remained attached to each other until around 80 million years ago); thus, the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans were newly formed. Such active rifting lifted great undersea mountain chains along the welts, raising eustatic sea levels worldwide. To the north of Africa the Tethys Sea continued to narrow. During most of the Late Cretaceous, North America would be divided in two by the Western Interior Seaway , a large interior sea, separating Laramidia to the west and Appalachia to the east, then receded late in the period, leaving thick marine deposits sandwiched between coal beds. Bivalve palaeobiogeography also indicates that Africa was split in half by a shallow sea during the Coniacian and Santonian, connecting the Tethys with the South Atlantic by way of the central Sahara and Central Africa, which were then underwater. [ 24 ] Yet another shallow seaway ran between what is now Norway and Greenland, connecting the Tethys to the Arctic Ocean and enabling biotic exchange between the two oceans. [ 25 ] At the peak of the Cretaceous transgression , one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged. [ 26 ] 

The Cretaceous is justly famous for its chalk ; indeed, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the Phanerozoic . [ 27 ] Mid-ocean ridge activity—or rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium ; this made the oceans more saturated, as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for calcareous nanoplankton . [ 28 ] These widespread carbonates and other sedimentary deposits make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine. Famous formations from North America include the rich marine fossils of Kansas 's Smoky Hill Chalk Member and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation . Other important Cretaceous exposures occur in Europe (e.g., the Weald ) and China (the Yixian Formation ). In the area that is now India, massive lava beds called the Deccan Traps erupted in the very late Cretaceous and early Paleocene.

Palynological evidence indicates the Cretaceous climate had three broad phases: a Berriasian–Barremian warm-dry phase, an Aptian–Santonian warm-wet phase, and a Campanian–Maastrichtian cool-dry phase. [ 29 ] As in the Cenozoic, the 400,000 year eccentricity cycle was the dominant orbital cycle governing carbon flux between different reservoirs and influencing global climate. [ 30 ] The location of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) was roughly the same as in the present. [ 31 ] 

The cooling trend of the last epoch of the Jurassic, the Tithonian, continued into the Berriasian, the first age of the Cretaceous. [ 32 ] The North Atlantic seaway opened and enabled the flow of cool water from the Boreal Ocean into the Tethys. [ 33 ] There is evidence that snowfalls were common in the higher latitudes during this age, and the tropics became wetter than during the Triassic and Jurassic. Glaciation was restricted to high- latitude mountains, though seasonal snow may have existed farther from the poles. [ 32 ] After the end of the first age, however, temperatures began to increase again, with a number of thermal excursions, such as the middle Valanginian Weissert Thermal Excursion (WTX), [ 34 ] which was caused by the Paraná-Etendeka Large Igneous Province's activity. [ 35 ] It was followed by the middle Hauterivian Faraoni Thermal Excursion (FTX) and the early Barremian Hauptblatterton Thermal Event (HTE). The HTE marked the ultimate end of the Tithonian-early Barremian Cool Interval (TEBCI). [ 34 ] During this interval, precession was the dominant orbital driver of environmental changes in the Vocontian Basin. [ 36 ] For much of the TEBCI, northern Gondwana experienced a monsoonal climate. [ 37 ] A shallow thermocline existed in the mid-latitude Tethys. [ 38 ] The TEBCI was followed by the Barremian-Aptian Warm Interval (BAWI). [ 34 ] This hot climatic interval coincides with Manihiki and Ontong Java Plateau volcanism and with the Selli Event . [ 39 ] Early Aptian tropical sea surface temperatures (SSTs) were 27–32 °C, based on TEX 86 measurements from the equatorial Pacific. [ 40 ] During the Aptian, Milankovitch cycles governed the occurrence of anoxic events by modulating the intensity of the hydrological cycle and terrestrial runoff. [ 41 ] The early Aptian was also notable for its millennial scale hyperarid events in the mid-latitudes of Asia. [ 42 ] The BAWI itself was followed by the Aptian-Albian Cold Snap (AACS) that began about 118 Ma. [ 34 ] A short, relatively minor ice age may have occurred during this so-called "cold snap", as evidenced by glacial dropstones in the western parts of the Tethys Ocean [ 43 ] and the expansion of calcareous nannofossils that dwelt in cold water into lower latitudes. [ 44 ] The AACS is associated with an arid period in the Iberian Peninsula . [ 45 ] 

Temperatures increased drastically after the end of the AACS, [ 46 ] which ended around 111 Ma with the Paquier/Urbino Thermal Maximum, giving way to the Mid-Cretaceous Hothouse (MKH), which lasted from the early Albian until the early Campanian. [ 34 ] Faster rates of seafloor spreading and entry of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere are believed to have initiated this period of extreme warmth, [ 47 ] along with high flood basalt activity. [ 48 ] The MKH was punctuated by multiple thermal maxima of extreme warmth. The Leenhardt Thermal Event (LTE) occurred around 110 Ma, followed shortly by the l'Arboudeyesse Thermal Event (ATE) a million years later. Following these two hyperthermals was the Amadeus Thermal Maximum around 106 Ma, during the middle Albian. Then, around a million years after that, occurred the Petite Verol Thermal Event (PVTE). Afterwards, around 102.5 Ma, the Event 6 Thermal Event (EV6) took place; this event was itself followed by the Breistroffer Thermal Maximum around 101 Ma, during the latest Albian. Approximately 94 Ma, the Cenomanian-Turonian Thermal Maximum occurred, [ 34 ] with this hyperthermal being the most extreme hothouse interval of the Cretaceous [ 49 ] [ 50 ] [ 51 ] and being associated with a sea level highstand. [ 52 ] Temperatures cooled down slightly over the next few million years, but then another thermal maximum, the Coniacian Thermal Maximum, happened, with this thermal event being dated to around 87 Ma. [ 34 ] Atmospheric CO 2 levels may have varied by thousands of ppm throughout the MKH. [ 53 ] Mean annual temperatures at the poles during the MKH exceeded 14 °C. [ 54 ] Such hot temperatures during the MKH resulted in a very gentle temperature gradient from the equator to the poles; the latitudinal temperature gradient during the Cenomanian-Turonian Thermal Maximum was 0.54 °C per ° latitude for the Southern Hemisphere and 0.49 °C per ° latitude for the Northern Hemisphere, in contrast to present day values of 1.07 and 0.69 °C per ° latitude for the Southern and Northern hemispheres, respectively. [ 55 ] This meant weaker global winds, which drive the ocean currents, and resulted in less upwelling and more stagnant oceans than today. [ 56 ] This is evidenced by widespread black shale deposition and frequent anoxic events . [ 21 ] Tropical SSTs during the late Albian most likely averaged around 30 °C. Despite this high SST, seawater was not hypersaline at this time, as this would have required significantly higher temperatures still. [ 57 ] On land, arid zones in the Albian regularly expanded northward in tandem with expansions of subtropical high pressure belts. [ 58 ] The Cedar Mountain Formation's Soap Wash flora indicates a mean annual temperature of between 19 and 26 °C in Utah at the Albian-Cenomanian boundary. [ 59 ] Tropical SSTs during the Cenomanian-Turonian Thermal Maximum were at least 30 °C, [ 60 ] though one study estimated them as high as between 33 and 42 °C. [ 61 ] An intermediate estimate of ~33-34 °C has also been given. [ 62 ] Meanwhile, deep ocean temperatures were as much as 15 to 20 °C (27 to 36 °F) warmer than today's; [ 63 ] one study estimated that deep ocean temperatures were between 12 and 20 °C during the MKH. [ 64 ] The poles were so warm that ectothermic reptiles were able to inhabit them. [ 65 ] 

Beginning in the Santonian, near the end of the MKH, the global climate began to cool, with this cooling trend continuing across the Campanian. [ 66 ] This period of cooling, driven by falling levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, [ 64 ] caused the end of the MKH and the transition into a cooler climatic interval, known formally as the Late Cretaceous-Early Palaeogene Cool Interval (LKEPCI). [ 34 ] Tropical SSTs declined from around 35 °C in the early Campanian to around 28 °C in the Maastrichtian. [ 67 ] Deep ocean temperatures declined to 9 to 12 °C, [ 64 ] though the shallow temperature gradient between tropical and polar seas remained. [ 68 ] Regional conditions in the Western Interior Seaway changed little between the MKH and the LKEPCI. [ 69 ] During this period of relatively cool temperatures, the ITCZ became narrower, [ 70 ] while the strength of both summer and winter monsoons in East Asia was directly correlated to atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. [ 71 ] Laramidia likewise had a seasonal, monsoonal climate. [ 72 ] The Maastrichtian was a time of chaotic, highly variable climate. [ 73 ] Two upticks in global temperatures are known to have occurred during the Maastrichtian, bucking the trend of overall cooler temperatures during the LKEPCI. Between 70 and 69 Ma and 66–65 Ma, isotopic ratios indicate elevated atmospheric CO 2 pressures with levels of 1000–1400 ppmV and mean annual temperatures in west Texas between 21 and 23 °C (70 and 73 °F). Atmospheric CO 2 and temperature relations indicate a doubling of pCO 2 was accompanied by a ~0.6 °C increase in temperature. [ 74 ] The latter warming interval, occurring at the very end of the Cretaceous, was triggered by the activity of the Deccan Traps. [ 75 ] The LKEPCI lasted into the Late Palaeocene , when it gave way to another supergreenhouse interval. [ 34 ]

The production of large quantities of magma, variously attributed to mantle plumes or to extensional tectonics , [ 76 ] further pushed sea levels up, so that large areas of the continental crust were covered with shallow seas. The Tethys Sea connecting the tropical oceans east to west also helped to warm the global climate. Warm-adapted plant fossils are known from localities as far north as Alaska and Greenland , while dinosaur fossils have been found within 15 degrees of the Cretaceous south pole . [ 77 ] It was suggested that there was Antarctic marine glaciation in the Turonian Age, based on isotopic evidence. [ 78 ] However, this has subsequently been suggested to be the result of inconsistent isotopic proxies, [ 79 ] with evidence of polar rainforests during this time interval at 82° S. [ 80 ] Rafting by ice of stones into marine environments occurred during much of the Cretaceous, but evidence of deposition directly from glaciers is limited to the Early Cretaceous of the Eromanga Basin in southern Australia . [ 81 ] [ 82 ] 

High temperatures fueling massive storms, hurricanes, and wildfires caused damages to trees. This along with arthropod damage caused trees during this time to produce large amounts of resin leading to the Cretaceous Resinous Interval lasting from 125 to 75 million years ago. [ 83 ]

Main article: Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution 

Flowering plants (angiosperms) make up around 90% of living plant species today. Prior to the rise of angiosperms, during the Jurassic and the Early Cretaceous, the higher flora was dominated by gymnosperm groups, including cycads , conifers , ginkgophytes , gnetophytes and close relatives, as well as the extinct Bennettitales . Other groups of plants included pteridosperms or "seed ferns", a collective term that refers to disparate groups of extinct seed plants with fern-like foliage, including groups such as Corystospermaceae and Caytoniales . The exact origins of angiosperms are uncertain, although molecular evidence suggests that they are not closely related to any living group of gymnosperms. [ 84 ] 

The earliest widely accepted evidence of flowering plants are monosulcate (single-grooved) pollen grains from the late Valanginian (~ 134 Ma) found in Israel [ 85 ] and Italy, [ 86 ] initially at low abundance. Molecular clock estimates conflict with fossil estimates, suggesting the diversification of crown-group angiosperms during the Late Triassic or the Jurassic, but such estimates are difficult to reconcile with the heavily sampled pollen record and the distinctive tricolpate to tricolporoidate (triple grooved) pollen of eudicot angiosperms. [ 84 ] Among the oldest records of Angiosperm macrofossils are Montsechia from the Barremian aged Las Hoyas beds of Spain and Archaefructus from the Barremian-Aptian boundary Yixian Formation in China. Tricolpate pollen distinctive of eudicots first appears in the Late Barremian, while the earliest remains of monocots are known from the Aptian . [ 84 ] Flowering plants underwent a rapid radiation beginning during the middle Cretaceous, becoming the dominant group of land plants by the end of the period, coincident with the decline of previously dominant groups such as conifers. [ 87 ] The oldest known fossils of grasses are from the Albian , [ 88 ] with the family having diversified into modern groups by the end of the Cretaceous. [ 89 ] The oldest large angiosperm trees are known from the Turonian (c. 90 Ma) of New Jersey, with the trunk having a preserved diameter of 1.8 metres (5.9 ft) and an estimated height of 50 metres (160 ft). [ 90 ] 

During the Cretaceous, ferns in the order Polypodiales , which make up 80% of living fern species, would also begin to diversify. [ 91 ] 

# Terrestrial fauna 
[ edit ] 

On land, mammals were generally small sized, but a very relevant component of the fauna , with cimolodont multituberculates outnumbering dinosaurs in some sites. [ 92 ] Neither true marsupials nor placentals existed until the very end, [ 93 ] but a variety of non-marsupial metatherians and non-placental eutherians had already begun to diversify greatly, ranging as carnivores ( Deltatheroida ), aquatic foragers ( Stagodontidae ) and herbivores ( Schowalteria , Zhelestidae ). Various "archaic" groups like eutriconodonts were common in the Early Cretaceous, but by the Late Cretaceous northern mammalian faunas were dominated by multituberculates and therians , with dryolestoids dominating South America . 

The apex predators were archosaurian reptiles , especially dinosaurs , which were at their most diverse stage. Avians such as the ancestors of modern-day birds also diversified. They inhabited every continent, and were even found in cold polar latitudes. Pterosaurs were common in the early and middle Cretaceous, but as the Cretaceous proceeded they declined for poorly understood reasons (once thought to be due to competition with early birds , but now it is understood avian adaptive radiation is not consistent with pterosaur decline [ 94 ] ). By the end of the period only three highly specialized families remained; Pteranodontidae , Nyctosauridae , and Azhdarchidae . [ 95 ] 

The Liaoning lagerstätte ( Yixian Formation ) in China is an important site, full of preserved remains of numerous types of small dinosaurs, birds and mammals, that provides a glimpse of life in the Early Cretaceous. The coelurosaur dinosaurs found there represent types of the group Maniraptora , which includes modern birds and their closest non-avian relatives, such as dromaeosaurs , oviraptorosaurs , therizinosaurs , troodontids along with other avialans . Fossils of these dinosaurs from the Liaoning lagerstätte are notable for the presence of hair-like feathers . 

Insects diversified during the Cretaceous, and the oldest known ants , termites and some lepidopterans , akin to butterflies and moths , appeared. Aphids , grasshoppers and gall wasps appeared. [ 96 ]

# Rhynchocephalians 
[ edit ]

Rhynchocephalians (which today only includes the tuatara ) disappeared from North America and Europe after the Early Cretaceous , [ 97 ] and were absent from North Africa [ 98 ] and northern South America [ 99 ] by the early Late Cretaceous . The cause of the decline of Rhynchocephalia remains unclear, but has often been suggested to be due to competition with advanced lizards and mammals. [ 100 ] They appear to have remained diverse in high-latitude southern South America during the Late Cretaceous, where lizards remained rare, with their remains outnumbering terrestrial lizards 200:1. [ 98 ] 

# Choristodera 
[ edit ] 
Philydrosaurus , a choristodere from the Early Cretaceous of China 

Choristoderes , a group of freshwater aquatic reptiles that first appeared during the preceding Jurassic, underwent a major evolutionary radiation in Asia during the Early Cretaceous, which represents the high point of choristoderan diversity, including long necked forms such as Hyphalosaurus and the first records of the gharial-like Neochoristodera , which appear to have evolved in the regional absence of aquatic neosuchian crocodyliformes. During the Late Cretaceous the neochoristodere Champsosaurus was widely distributed across western North America. [ 101 ] Due to the extreme climatic warmth in the Arctic, choristoderans were able to colonise it too during the Late Cretaceous. [ 65 ] 

# Marine fauna 
[ edit ] 

In the seas, rays , modern sharks and teleosts became common. [ 102 ] Marine reptiles included ichthyosaurs in the early and mid-Cretaceous (becoming extinct during the late Cretaceous Cenomanian-Turonian anoxic event ), plesiosaurs throughout the entire period, and mosasaurs appearing in the Late Cretaceous. Sea turtles in the form of Cheloniidae and Panchelonioidea lived during the period and survived the extinction event. Besides Cheloniidae, Panchelonioidea is today represented by a single species; the leatherback sea turtle . The Hesperornithiformes were flightless, marine diving birds that swam like grebes . 

Baculites , an ammonite genus with a straight shell, flourished in the seas along with reef-building rudist clams. Inoceramids were also particularly notable among Cretaceous bivalves, [ 103 ] and they have been used to identify major biotic turnovers such as at the Turonian-Coniacian boundary. [ 104 ] [ 105 ] Predatory gastropods with drilling habits were widespread. [ 106 ] Globotruncanid foraminifera and echinoderms such as sea urchins and starfish (sea stars) thrived. Ostracods were abundant in Cretaceous marine settings; ostracod species characterised by high male sexual investment had the highest rates of extinction and turnover. [ 107 ] Thylacocephala , a class of crustaceans, went extinct in the Late Cretaceous. The first radiation of the diatoms (generally siliceous shelled, rather than calcareous ) in the oceans occurred during the Cretaceous; freshwater diatoms did not appear until the Miocene . [ 96 ] Calcareous nannoplankton were important components of the marine microbiota and important as biostratigraphic markers and recorders of environmental change. [ 108 ] 

The Cretaceous was also an important interval in the evolution of bioerosion , the production of borings and scrapings in rocks, hardgrounds and shells.

The Paleogene Period ( IPA : / ˈ p eɪ l i . ə dʒ iː n , - l i . oʊ -, ˈ p æ l i -/ PAY -lee-ə-jeen, -⁠lee-oh-, PAL -ee- ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene ) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period 66 Ma (million years ago) to the beginning of the Neogene Period 23.04 Ma. It is the first period of the Cenozoic Era , the tenth period of the Phanerozoic and is divided into the Paleocene , Eocene , and Oligocene epochs. The earlier term Tertiary Period was used to define the time now covered by the Paleogene Period and subsequent Neogene Period; despite no longer being recognized as a formal stratigraphic term , "Tertiary" still sometimes remains in informal use. [ 5 ] Paleogene is often abbreviated "Pg", although the United States Geological Survey uses the abbreviation " Pe " for the Paleogene on the Survey's geologic maps. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] 

Much of the world's modern vertebrate diversity originated in a rapid surge of diversification in the early Paleogene, as survivors of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event took advantage of empty ecological niches left behind by the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs, pterosaurs, marine reptiles, and primitive fish groups. Mammals continued to diversify from relatively small, simple forms into a highly diverse group ranging from small-bodied forms to very large ones, radiating into multiple orders and colonizing the air and marine ecosystems by the Eocene . [ 8 ] Birds , the only surviving group of dinosaurs, quickly diversified from the very few neognath and paleognath clades that survived the extinction event, also radiating into multiple orders, colonizing different ecosystems and achieving an extreme level of morphological diversity. [ 9 ] Percomorph fish, the most diverse group of vertebrates today, first appeared near the end of the Cretaceous but saw a very rapid radiation into their modern order and family-level diversity during the Paleogene, achieving a diverse array of morphologies. [ 10 ] 

The Paleogene is marked by considerable changes in climate from the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum , through global cooling during the Eocene to the first appearance of permanent ice sheets in the Antarctic at the beginning of the Oligocene. [ 11 ] 

# Geology 
[ edit ] 

# Stratigraphy 
[ edit ] 

The Paleogene is divided into three series / epochs : the Paleocene, Eocene, and Oligocene. These stratigraphic units can be defined globally or regionally. For global stratigraphic correlation, the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) ratify global stages based on a Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) from a single formation (a stratotype ) identifying the lower boundary of the stage. [ 12 ] 

# Paleocene 
[ edit ] 

The Paleocene is the first series/epoch of the Paleogene and lasted from 66.0 Ma to 56.0 Ma. It is divided into three stages: the Danian 66.0 - 61.6 Ma; Selandian 61.6 - 59.2 Ma; and, Thanetian 59.2 - 56.0 Ma. [ 13 ] The GSSP for the base of the Cenozoic, Paleogene and Paleocene is at Oued Djerfane, west of El Kef , Tunisia . It is marked by an iridium anomaly produced by an asteroid impact, and is associated with the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The boundary is defined as the rusty colored base of a 50 cm thick clay , which would have been deposited over only a few days. Similar layers are seen in marine and continental deposits worldwide. These layers include the iridium anomaly, microtektites , nickel -rich spinel crystals and shocked quartz , all indicators of a major extraterrestrial impact. The remains of the crater are found at Chicxulub on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico . The extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs , ammonites and dramatic changes in marine plankton and many other groups of organisms, are also used for correlation purposes. [ 13 ]

The Eocene is the second series/epoch of the Paleogene, and lasted from 56.0 Ma to 33.9 Ma. It is divided into four stages: the Ypresian 56.0 Ma to 47.8 Ma; Lutetian 47.8 Ma to 41.2 Ma; Bartonian 41.2 Ma to 37.71 Ma; and, Priabonian 37.71 Ma to 33.9 Ma. The GSSP for the base of the Eocene is at Dababiya, near Luxor , Egypt and is marked by the start of a significant variation in global carbon isotope ratios, produced by a major period of global warming. The change in climate was due to a rapid release of frozen methane clathrates from seafloor sediments at the beginning of the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM). [ 13 ] 

# Oligocene 
[ edit ] 

The Oligocene is the third and youngest series/epoch of the Paleogene, and lasted from 33.9 Ma to 23.03 Ma. It is divided into two stages: the Rupelian 33.9 Ma to 27.82 Ma; and, Chattian 27.82 - 23.03 Ma. The GSSP for the base of the Oligocene is at Massignano , near Ancona , Italy . The extinction of the hantkeninid planktonic foraminifera is the key marker for the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, which was a time of climate cooling that led to widespread changes in fauna and flora. [ 13 ] 

# Palaeogeography 
[ edit ] 

The final stages of the breakup of Pangaea occurred during the Paleogene as Atlantic Ocean rifting and seafloor spreading extended northwards, separating the North America and Eurasian plates, and Australia and South America rifted from Antarctica , opening the Southern Ocean . Africa and India collided with Eurasia forming the Alpine-Himalayan mountain chains and the western margin of the Pacific plate changed from a divergent to convergent plate boundary. [ 14 ] 

# Alpine–Himalayan orogeny 
[ edit ] 

# Alpine orogeny 
[ edit ] 

The Alpine orogeny developed in response to the collision between the African and Eurasian plates during the closing of the Neotethys Ocean and the opening of the Central Atlantic Ocean. The result was a series of arcuate mountain ranges, from the Tell - Rif - Betic cordillera in the western Mediterranean through the Alps , Carpathians , Apennines , Dinarides and Hellenides to the Taurides in the east. [ 15 ] [ 14 ] 

From the Late Cretaceous into the early Paleocene, Africa began to converge with Eurasia. The irregular outlines of the continental margins, including the Adriatic promontory (Adria) that extended north from the African plate, led to the development of several short subduction zones, rather than one long system. [ 15 ] In the western Mediterranean, the European plate was subducted southwards beneath the African plate, whilst in the eastern Mediterranean, Africa was subducted beneath Eurasia along a northward dipping subduction zone. [ 14 ] [ 16 ] Convergence between the Iberian and European plates led to the Pyrenean orogeny [ 17 ] and, as Adria pushed northwards the Alps and Carpathian orogens began to develop. [ 18 ] [ 16 ] 
Present day tectonic map of southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, showing structures of the western Alpine-Himalayan orogenic belt. 

The collision of Adria with Eurasia in the early Palaeocene was followed by a c.10 million year pause in the convergence of Africa and Eurasia, connected with the onset of the opening of the North Atlantic Ocean as Greenland rifted from the Eurasian plate in the Palaeocene. [ 18 ] Convergence rates between Africa and Eurasia increased again in the early Eocene and the remaining oceanic basins between Adria and Europe closed. [ 15 ] [ 19 ] 

Between about 40 and 30 Ma, subduction began along the western Mediterranean arc of the Tell, Rif, Betic and Apennine mountain chains. The rate of convergence was less than the subduction rate of the dense lithosphere of the western Mediterranean and roll-back of the subducting slab led to the arcuate structure of these mountain ranges. [ 15 ] [ 17 ] 

In the eastern Mediterranean, c. 35 Ma, the Anatolide-Tauride platform (northern part of Adria) began to enter the trench leading to the development of the Dinarides, Hellenides and Tauride mountain chains as the passive margin sediments of Adria were scrapped off onto the Eurasia crust during subduction. [ 15 ] [ 20 ] 

# Zagros Mountains 
[ edit ] 

The Zagros mountain belt stretches for c. 2000 km from the eastern border of Iraq to the Makran coast in southern Iran . It formed as a result of the convergence and collision of the Arabian and Eurasian plates as the Neotethys Ocean closed and is composed sediments scrapped from the descending Arabian Plate. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] 

From the Late Cretaceous, a volcanic arc developed on the Eurasia margin as the Neotethys crust was subducted beneath it. A separate intra-oceanic subduction zone in the Neotethys resulted in the obuction of ocean crust onto the Arabian margin in the Late Cretaceous to Paleocene, with break-off of the subducted oceanic plate close to the Arabian margin occurring during the Eocene. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] Continental collision began during the Eocene c. 35 Ma and continued into the Oligocene to c. 26 Ma. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] 

# Himalayan orogeny 
[ edit ] 
Map showing the northwards drift of the Indian continent between 71 and 0 Ma. The leading edge of Greater India (not shown on the map) collided with the Eurasian plate c. 55 Ma, whilst India itself still lay to the south. (From: Dèzes, 1999) 

The Indian continent rifted from Madagascar at c. 83 Ma and drifted rapidly (c. 18 cm/yr in the Paleocene) northwards towards the southern margin of Eurasia. A rapid decrease in velocity to c. 5 cm/yr in the early Eocene records the collision of the Tethyan (Tibetan) Himalayas , the leading edge of Greater India, with the Lhasa terrane of Tibet (southern Eurasian margin), along the Indus-Yarling-Zangbo suture zone . [ 14 ] [ 23 ] To the south of this zone, the Himalaya are composed of metasedimentary rocks scraped off the now subducted Indian continental crust and mantle lithosphere as the collision progressed. [ 14 ] 

Palaeomagnetic data place the present day Indian continent further south at the time of collision and decrease in plate velocity, indicating the presence of a large region to the north of India that has now been subducted beneath the Eurasian plate or incorporated into the mountain belt. This region, known as Greater India, formed by extension along the northern margin of India during the opening of the Neotethys. The Tethyan Himalaya block lay along its northern edge, with the Neotethys Ocean lying between it and southern Eurasia. [ 14 ] [ 24 ] 

Debate about the amount of deformation seen in the geological record in the India–Eurasia collision zone versus the size of Greater India, the timing and nature of the collision relative to the decrease in plate velocity, and explanations for the unusually high velocity of the Indian plate have led to several models for Greater India: 1) A Late Cretaceous to early Paleocene subduction zone may have lain between India and Eurasia in the Neotethys, dividing the region into two plates, subduction was followed by collision of India with Eurasia in the middle Eocene. In this model Greater India would have been less than 900 km wide; [ 24 ] 2) Greater India may have formed a single plate, several thousand kilometres wide, with the Tethyan Himalaya microcontinent separated from the Indian continent by an oceanic basin . The microcontinent collided with southern Eurasia c. 58 Ma (late Paleocene), whilst the velocity of the plate did not decrease until c. 50 Ma when subduction rates dropped as young, oceanic crust entered the subduction zone; [ 25 ] 3) This model assigns older dates to parts of Greater India, which changes its paleogeographic position relative to Eurasia and creates a Greater India formed of extended continental crust 2000–3000 km wide. [ 26 ] 

# South East Asia 
[ edit ] 

The Alpine-Himalayan Orogenic Belt in Southeast Asia extends from the Himalayas in India through Myanmar ( West Burma block ) Sumatra , Java to West Sulawesi . [ 27 ] 

During the Late Cretaceous to Paleogene, the northward movement of the Indian plate led to the highly oblique subduction of the Neotethys along the edge of the West Burma block and the development of a major north-south transform fault along the margin of Southeast Asia to the south. [ 28 ] [ 27 ] Between c. 60 and 50 Ma, the leading northeastern edge of Greater India collided with the West Burma block resulting in deformation and metamorphism . [ 28 ] During the middle Eocene, north-dipping subduction resumed along the southern edge of Southeast Asia, from west Sumatra to West Sulawesi, as the Australian plate drifted slowly northwards. [ 27 ] 

Collision between India and the West Burma block was complete by the late Oligocene. As the India-Eurasia collision continued, movement of material away from the collision zone was accommodated along, and extended, the already existing major strike slip systems of the region. [ 28 ] 

# Atlantic Ocean 
[ edit ] 

During the Paleocene, seafloor spreading along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge propagated from the Central Atlantic northwards between North America and Greenland in the Labrador Sea (c. 62 Ma) and Baffin Bay (c. 57 Ma), and, by the early Eocene (c. 54 Ma), into the northeastern Atlantic between Greenland and Eurasia. [ 14 ] [ 29 ] Extension between North America and Eurasia, also in the early Eocene, led to the opening of the Eurasian Basin across the Arctic, which was linked to the Baffin Bay Ridge and Mid-Atlantic Ridge to the south via major strike slip faults. [ 14 ] [ 30 ] 

From the Eocene and into the early Oligocene, Greenland acted as an independent plate moving northwards and rotating anticlockwise. This led to compression across the Canadian Arctic Archipelago , Svalbard and northern Greenland resulting in the Eureka orogeny . [ 14 ] [ 30 ] From c. 47 Ma, the eastern margin of Greenland was cut by the Reykjanes Ridge (the northeastern branch of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge) propagating northwards and splitting off the Jan Mayen microcontinent . [ 14 ] 

After c. 33 Ma seafloor spreading in Labrador Sea and Baffin Bay gradually ceased and seafloor spreading focused along the northeast Atlantic. By the late Oligocene, the plate boundary between North America and Eurasia was established along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, with Greenland attached to the North American plate again, and the Jan Mayen microcontinent part of the Eurasian plate, where its remains now lie to the east and possibly beneath the southeast of Iceland. [ 14 ] [ 30 ] 

# North Atlantic Large Igneous Province 
[ edit ] 
A Paleogene-aged basaltic lava flow on the Isle of Staffa , Scotland (person standing on cliff top for scale). The bottom section of this cliff is volcaniclastic rock . The middle and top sections are two parts of a single basaltic lava flow; each part of the lava flow cooled differently, forming rock with different characteristics. The middle layer shows spectacular columnar jointing resulting from relatively slow cooling; the top layer has very irregular closely-spaced joints caused by more rapid cooling. [ 31 ] 

The North Atlantic Igneous Province stretches across the Greenland and northwest European margins and is associated with the proto-Icelandic mantle plume , which rose beneath the Greenland lithosphere at c. 65 Ma. [ 30 ] There were two main phases of volcanic activity with peaks at c. 60 Ma and c. 55 Ma. Magmatism in the British and Northwest Atlantic volcanic provinces occurred mainly in the early Palaeocene, the latter associated with an increased spreading rate in the Labrador Sea, whilst northeast Atlantic magmatism occurred mainly during the early Eocene and is associated with a change in the spreading direction in the Labrador Sea and the northward drift of Greenland. The locations of the magmatism coincide with the intersection of propagating the rifts and large-scale, pre-existing lithospheric structures, which acted as channels to the surface for the magma . [ 30 ] [ 32 ] 

The arrival of the proto-Iceland plume has been considered the driving mechanism for rifting in the North Atlantic. However, that rifting and initial seafloor spreading occurred prior to the arrival of the plume, large scale magmatism occurred at a distance to rifting, and that rifting propagated towards, rather than away from the plume, has led to the suggestion the plume and associated magmatism may have been a result, rather than a cause, of the plate tectonic forces that led to the propagation of rifting from the Central to the North Atlantic. [ 30 ] [ 32 ] 

# Americas 
[ edit ] 

# North America 
[ edit ] 

Mountain building continued along the North America Cordillera in response to subduction of the Farallon plate beneath the North American Plate. Along the central section of the North American margin, crustal shortening of the Cretaceous to Paleocene Sevier orogen lessened and deformation moved eastward. The decreasing dip of the subducting Farallon plate led to a flat-slab segment that increased friction between this and the base of the North American Plate. The resulting Laramide orogeny , which began the development of the Rocky Mountains , was a broad zone of thick-skinned deformation , with faults extending to mid-crustal depths and the uplift of basement rocks that lay to the east of the Sevier belt, and more than 700km from the trench. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] With the Laramide uplift the Western Interior Seaway was divided and then retreated. [ 33 ] 

During the mid to late Eocene (50–35 Ma), plate convergence rates decreased and the dip of the Farallon slab began to steepen. Uplift ceased and the region largely levelled by erosion . By the Oligocene, convergence gave way to extension, rifting and widespread volcanism across the Laramide belt. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] 

# South America 
[ edit ] 

Ocean-continent convergence accommodated by east dipping subduction zone of the Farallon plate beneath the western edge of South America continued from the Mesozoic. [ 35 ] 

Over the Paleogene, changes in plate motion and episodes of regional slab shallowing and steepening resulted in variations in the magnitude of crustal shortening and amounts of magmatism along the length of the Andes . [ 35 ] In the Northern Andes, an oceanic plateau with volcanic arc was accreted during the latest Cretaceous and Paleocene, whilst the Central Andes were dominated by the subduction of oceanic crust and the Southern Andes were impacted by the subduction of the Farallon-East Antarctic ocean ridge. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] 

# Caribbean 
[ edit ] 

The Caribbean plate is largely composed of oceanic crust of the Caribbean Large Igneous Province that formed during the Late Cretaceous. [ 37 ] During the Late Cretaceous to Paleocene, subduction of Atlantic crust was established along its northern margin, whilst to the southwest, an island arc collided with the northern Andes forming an east dipping subduction zone where Caribbean lithosphere was subducted beneath the South American margin. [ 38 ] 

During the Eocene (c. 45 Ma), subduction of the Farallon plate along the Central American subduction zone was (re)established. [ 37 ] Subduction along the northern section of the Caribbean volcanic arc ceased as the Bahamas carbonate platform collided with Cuba and was replaced by strike-slip movements as a transform fault, extending from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, connected with the northern boundary of the Caribbean Plate. Subduction now focused along the southern Caribbean arc ( Lesser Antilles ). [ 37 ] [ 39 ] 

By the Oligocene, the intra-oceanic Central American volcanic arc began to collide with northwestern South American. [ 38 ] 

# Pacific Ocean 
[ edit ] 

At the beginning of the Paleogene, the Pacific Ocean consisted of the Pacific, Farallon, Kula and Izanagi plates. The central Pacific plate grew by seafloor spreading as the other three plates were subducted and broken up. In the southern Pacific, seafloor spreading continued from the Late Cretaceous across the Pacific–Antarctic, Pacific-Farallon and Farallon–Antarctic mid ocean ridges. [ 14 ] 

The Izanagi-Pacific spreading ridge lay nearly parallel to the East Asian subduction zone and between 60–50 Ma the spreading ridge began to be subducted. By c. 50 Ma, the Pacific plate was no longer surrounded by spreading ridges, but had a subduction zone along its western edge. This changed the forces acting on the Pacific plate and led to a major reorganisation of plate motions across the entire Pacific region. [ 40 ] The resulting changes in stress between the Pacific and Philippine Sea plates initiated subduction along the Izu-Bonin-Mariana and Tonga-Kermadec arcs. [ 40 ] [ 37 ] 

Subduction of the Farallon plate beneath the American plates continued from the Late Cretaceous. [ 14 ] The Kula-Farallon spreading ridge lay to its north until the Eocene (c. 55 Ma), when the northern section of the plate split forming the Vancouver/Juan de Fuca plate . [ 37 ] In the Oligocene (c. 28 Ma), the first segment of the Pacific–Farallon spreading ridge entered the North American subduction zone near Baja California [ 41 ] leading to major strike-slip movements and the formation of the San Andreas Fault . [ 14 ] At the Paleogene-Neogene boundary, spreading ceased between the Pacific and Farallon plates and the Farallon plate split again forming the present date Nazca and Cocos plates. [ 37 ] [ 41 ] 

The Kula plate lay between Pacific plate and North America. To the north and northwest it was being subducted beneath the Aleutian trench . [ 14 ] [ 37 ] Spreading between the Kula and Pacific and Farallon plates ceased c. 40 Ma and the Kula plate became part of the Pacific Plate. [ 14 ] [ 37 ] 

# Hawaii hotspot 
[ edit ] 

The Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain formed above the Hawaiian hotspot . Originally thought to be stationary within the mantle, the hotspot is now considered to have drifted south during the Paleocene to early Eocene, as the Pacific plate moved north. At c. 47 Ma, movement of the hotspot ceased and the Pacific plate motion changed from northward to northwestward in response to the onset of subduction along its western margin. This resulted in a 60 degree bend in the seamount chain. Other seamount chains related to hotspots in the South Pacific show a similar change in orientation at this time. [ 42 ] 

# Antarctica 
[ edit ] 

Slow seafloor spreading continued between Australia and East Antarctica. Shallow water channels probably developed south of Tasmania opening the Tasmanian Passage in the Eocene and deep ocean routes opening from the mid Oligocene. Rifting between the Antarctic Peninsula and the southern tip of South America formed the Drake Passage and opened the Southern Ocean also during this time, completing the breakup of Gondwana. The opening of these passages and the creation of the Southern Ocean established the Antarctic Circumpolar Current . Glaciers began to build across the Antarctica continent that now lay isolated in the south polar region and surrounded by cold ocean waters. These changes contributed to the fall in global temperatures and the beginning of icehouse conditions. [ 33 ]

# Red Sea and East Africa 
[ edit ] 

Extensional stresses from the subduction zone along the northern Neotethys resulted in rifting between Africa and Arabia, forming the Gulf of Aden in the late Eocene. [ 43 ] To the west, in the early Oligocene, flood basalts erupted across Ethiopia , northeast Sudan and southwest Yemen as the Afar mantle plume began to impact the base of the African lithosphere. [ 14 ] [ 43 ] Rifting across the southern Red Sea began in the mid Oligocene, and across the central and northern Red Sea regions in the late Oligocene and early Miocene. [ 43 ] 

# Climate 
[ edit ] 

Climatic conditions varied considerably during the Paleogene. After the disruption of the Chicxulub impact settled, a period of cool and dry conditions continued from the Late Cretaceous. At the Paleocene-Eocene boundary global temperatures rose rapidly with the onset of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). [ 14 ] By the middle Eocene, temperatures began to drop again and by the late Eocene (c. 37 Ma) had decreased sufficiently for ice sheets to form in Antarctica. The global climate entered icehouse conditions at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary and the present day Late Cenozoic ice age began. [ 33 ] 

The Paleogene began with the brief but intense " impact winter " caused by the Chicxulub impact , which was followed by an abrupt period of warming. After temperatures stabilised, the steady cooling and drying of the Late Cretaceous-Early Paleogene Cool Interval that had spanned the last two ages of the Late Cretaceous continued, [ 11 ] with only the brief interruption of the Latest Danian Event (c. 62.2 Ma) when global temperatures rose. [ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] There is no evidence for ice sheets at the poles during the Paleocene. [ 14 ] 

The relatively cool conditions were brought to an end by the Thanetian Thermal Event, and the beginning of the PETM. [ 11 ] This was one of the warmest times of the Phanerozoic eon, during which global mean surface temperatures increased to 31.6 °C. [ 47 ] According to a study published in 2018, from about 56 to 48 Ma, annual air temperatures over land and at mid-latitude averaged about 23–29 °C (± 4.7 °C). [ 48 ] [ 49 ] [ 50 ] For comparison, this was 10 to 15 °C higher than the current annual mean temperatures in these areas. [ 50 ] 

This rapid rise in global temperatures and intense greenhouse conditions were due to a sudden increase in levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and other greenhouse gases . [ 33 ] An accompanying rise in humidity is reflected in an increase in kaolinite in sediments, which forms by chemical weathering in hot, humid conditions. [ 14 ] Tropical and subtropical forests flourished and extended into polar regions. Water vapour (a greenhouse gas) associated with these forests also contributed to the greenhouse conditions. [ 33 ] 

The initial rise in global temperatures was related to the intrusion of magmatic sills into organic-rich sediments during volcanic activity in the North Atlantic Igneous Province, between about 56 and 54 Ma, which rapidly released large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. [ 14 ] This warming led to melting of frozen methane hydrates on continental slopes adding further greenhouses gases. It also reduced the rate of burial of organic matter as higher temperatures accelerated the rate of bacterial decomposition which released CO 2 back into the oceans. [ 33 ] 

The (relatively) sudden climatic changes associated with the PETM resulted in the extinction of some groups of fauna and flora and the rise of others. For example, with the warming of the Arctic Ocean, around 70% of deep sea foraminifera species went extinct, [ 33 ] whilst on land many modern mammals, including primates , appeared. [ 51 ] Fluctuating sea levels meant, during low stands, a land bridge formed across the Bering Straits between North America and Eurasia allowing the movement of land animals between the two continents. [ 14 ] 

The PETM was followed by the less severe Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 (c. 53.69 Ma), [ 52 ] and the Eocene Thermal Maximum 3 (c. 53 Ma). The early Eocene warm conditions were brought to an end by the Azolla event . This change of climate at about 48.5 Ma, is believed to have been caused by a proliferation of aquatic ferns from the genus Azolla , resulting in the sequestering of large amounts of CO 2 from the atmosphere by the plants. From this time until about 34 Ma, there was a slow cooling trend known as the Middle-Late Eocene Cooling. [ 11 ] As temperatures dropped at high latitudes the presence of cold water diatoms suggests sea ice was able to form in winter in the Arctic Ocean, [ 33 ] and by the late Eocene (c. 37 Ma) there is evidence of glaciation in Antarctica. [ 14 ] 

Changes in deep ocean currents, as Australia and South America moved away from Antarctica opening the Drake and Tasmanian passages, were responsible for the drop in global temperatures. The warm waters of the South Atlantic, Indian and South Pacific oceans extended southward into the opening Southern Ocean and became part of the cold circumpolar current. Dense polar waters sank into the deep oceans and moved northwards, reducing global ocean temperatures. This cooling may have occurred over less than 100,000 years and resulted in a widespread extinction in marine life. By the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, sediments deposited in the ocean from glaciers indicate the presence of an ice sheet in western Antarctica that extended to the ocean. [ 33 ] 

The development of the circumpolar current led to changes in the oceans, which in turn reduced atmospheric CO 2 further. Increasing upwellings of cold water stimulated the productivity of phytoplankton , and the cooler waters reduced the rate of bacterial decay of organic matter and promoted the growth of methane hydrates in marine sediments. This created a positive feedback cycle where global cooling reduced atmospheric CO 2 and this reduction in CO 2 lead to changes which further lowered global temperatures. The decrease in evaporation from the cooler oceans also reduced moisture in the atmosphere and increased aridity. By the early Oligocene, the North American and Eurasian tropical and subtropical forests were replaced by dry woodlands and widespread grasslands. [ 33 ] 

The Early Oligocene Glacial Maximum lasted for about 200,000 years, [ 53 ] and the global mean surface temperature continued to decrease gradually during the Rupelian . [ 11 ] A drop in global sea levels during the mid Oligocene indicates major growth of the Antarctic glacial ice sheet. [ 33 ] In the Late Oligocene , global temperatures began to warm slightly, though they continued to be significantly lower than during the previous epochs of the Paleogene and polar ice remained. [ 11 ] 

# Flora and fauna 
[ edit ] 
Restoration of Palaeotherium , which diversified in warmer climates 

Tropical taxa diversified faster than those at higher latitudes after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, resulting in the development of a significant latitudinal diversity gradient. [ 54 ] 

Mammals began a rapid diversification during this period. After the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which saw the demise of the non-avian dinosaurs , mammals began to evolve from a few small and generalized forms into most of the modern varieties we see presently. Some of these mammals evolved into large forms that dominated the land, while others became capable of living in marine , specialized terrestrial, and airborne environments. Those that adapted to the oceans became modern cetaceans and sirenians , while those that adapted to trees became animals such as Sciuridaes or primates , the group to which humans belong. 

Birds , extant dinosaurs which were already well established by the end of the Cretaceous , also experienced adaptive radiation as they took over the skies left empty by the now extinct pterosaurs . Some flightless birds such as penguins , ratites , and terror birds also filled niches left by the hesperornithes and other extinct dinosaurs. 

Myctophids first appeared in the Late Palaeocene or Early Eocene, and during the Eocene and most of the Oligocene were restricted to shelf seas before expanding their range into the open ocean during the warm climatic interval at the end of the Oligocene. [ 55 ] 

Pronounced cooling in the Oligocene resulted in a massive floral shift, and many extant modern plants arose during this time. Grasses and herbs, such as Artemisia , began to proliferate, at the expense of tropical plants, which began to decrease. Conifer forests developed in mountainous areas. This cooling trend continued, with major fluctuation, until the end of the Pleistocene period. [ 56 ] This evidence for this floral shift is found in the palynological record. [ 57 ]

The Neogene ( / ˈ n iː . ə dʒ iː n / NEE -ə-jeen , [ 6 ] [ 7 ] ) is a geologic period and system that spans 20.45 million years from the end of the Paleogene Period 23.04 Ma (million years ago) to the beginning of the present Quaternary Period 2.58 Ma. It is the second period of the Cenozoic and the eleventh period of the Phanerozoic . The Neogene is sub-divided into two epochs , the earlier Miocene and the later Pliocene . Some geologists assert that the Neogene cannot be clearly delineated from the modern geological period, the Quaternary . [ 8 ] The term "Neogene" was coined in 1853 by the Austrian palaeontologist Moritz Hörnes (1815–1868). [ 9 ] The earlier term Tertiary Period was used to define the span of time now covered by Paleogene and Neogene and, despite no longer being recognized as a formal stratigraphic term , "Tertiary" still sometimes remains in informal use. [ 10 ] 

During this period, mammals and birds continued to evolve into modern forms, while other groups of life remained relatively unchanged. The first humans ( Homo habilis ) appeared in Africa near the end of the period. [ 11 ] Some continental movements took place, the most significant event being the connection of North and South America at the Isthmus of Panama , late in the Pliocene. This cut off the warm ocean currents from the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean, leaving only the Gulf Stream to transfer heat to the Arctic Ocean . The global climate cooled considerably throughout the Neogene, culminating in a series of continental glaciations in the Quaternary Period that followed. 

# Divisions 
[ edit ] 

In ICS terminology, from upper (later, more recent) to lower (earlier): 

The Pliocene Epoch is subdivided into two ages: 

- Piacenzian Age, preceded by 
- Zanclean Age 

The Miocene Epoch is subdivided into six ages: 

- Messinian Age, preceded by 
- Tortonian Age 
- Serravallian Age 
- Langhian Age 
- Burdigalian Age 
- Aquitanian Age 

In different geophysical regions of the world, other regional names are also used for the same or overlapping ages and other timeline subdivisions. 

The terms Neogene System (formal) and Upper Tertiary System (informal) describe the rocks deposited during the Neogene Period . 

# Paleogeography 
[ edit ] 

The continents in the Neogene were very close to their current positions. The Isthmus of Panama formed, connecting North and South America . The Indian subcontinent continued to collide with Asia , forming the Himalayas . Sea levels fell, creating land bridges between Africa and Eurasia and between Eurasia and North America. 

# Climate 
[ edit ] 

The global climate became more seasonal and continued an overall drying and cooling trend which began during the Paleogene . The Early Miocene was relatively cool; [ 12 ] Early Miocene mid-latitude seawater and continental thermal gradients were already very similar to those of the present. [ 13 ] During the Middle Miocene , Earth entered a warm phase known as the Middle Miocene Climatic Optimum (MMCO), [ 12 ] which was driven by the emplacement of the Columbia River Basalt Group . [ 14 ] Around 11 Ma, the Middle Miocene Warm Interval gave way to the much cooler Late Miocene. [ 12 ] The ice caps on both poles began to grow and thicken, a process enhanced by positive feedbacks from increased formation of sea ice. [ 15 ] Between 7 and 5.3 Ma, a decrease in global temperatures termed the Late Miocene Cooling (LMC) ensued, driven by decreases in carbon dioxide concentrations. [ 16 ] During the Pliocene, from about 5.3 to 2.7 Ma, another warm interval occurred, being known as the Pliocene Warm Interval (PWI), interrupting the longer-term cooling trend. The Pliocene Thermal Maximum (PTM) occurred between 3.3 and 3.0 Ma. [ 12 ] During the Pliocene, Green Sahara phases of wet conditions in North Africa were frequent and occurred about every 21 kyr, being especially intense when Earth's orbit's eccentricity was high. [ 17 ] The PWI had similar levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide to contemporary times and is often seen as an analogous climate to the projected climate of the near future as a result of anthropogenic global warming . [ 18 ] Towards the end of the Pliocene, decreased heat transport towards the Antarctic resulting from a weakening of the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) cooled the Earth, a process that exacerbated itself in a positive feedback as sea levels dropped and the ITF diminished and further limited the heat transported southward by the Leeuwin Current . [ 19 ] By the end of the period the first of a series of glaciations of the current Ice Age began. [ 20 ] 

# Flora and fauna 
[ edit ] 

Marine and continental flora and fauna have a modern appearance. The reptile group Choristodera went extinct in the early part of the period, while the amphibians known as Allocaudata disappeared at the end of it. Neogene also marked the end of the reptilian genera Langstonia and Barinasuchus , terrestrial predators that were the last surviving members of Sebecosuchia , a group related to crocodiles. The oceans were dominated by large carnivores like megalodons and livyatans , and 19 million years ago about 70% of all pelagic shark species disappeared. [ 21 ] Mammals and birds continued to be the dominant terrestrial vertebrates, and took many forms as they adapted to various habitats. Ungulates in North America became noticeably more cursorial and increased their stride lengths across the Oligocene-Miocene boundary, likely in response to the increased habitat openness during the Miocene. [ 22 ] An explosive radiation of ursids took place at the Miocene-Pliocene boundary. [ 23 ] The first hominins , the ancestors of humans, appeared near the end of the period. [ 11 ] [ 24 ] 

About 20 Ma gymnosperms in the form of some conifer and cycad groups started to diversify and produce more species due to the changing conditions. [ 25 ] In response to the cooler, seasonal climate, tropical plant species gave way to deciduous ones and grasslands replaced many forests. Grasses therefore greatly diversified, and herbivorous mammals evolved alongside it, creating the many grazing animals of today such as horses , antelope , and bison . Ice age mammals like the mammoths and woolly rhinoceros were common in Pliocene . With lower levels of CO 2 in the atmosphere, C 4 plants expanded and reached ecological dominance in grasslands during the last 10 million years. Also Asteraceae (daisies) went through a significant adaptive radiation . [ 26 ] Eucalyptus fossil leaves occur in the Miocene of New Zealand, where the genus is not native today, but have been introduced from Australia. [ 27 ] 

# Disagreements 
[ edit ] 

The Neogene traditionally ended at the end of the Pliocene Epoch, just before the older definition of the beginning of the Quaternary Period; many time scales show this division. 

However, there was a movement amongst geologists (particularly marine geologists ) to also include ongoing geological time (Quaternary) in the Neogene, while others (particularly terrestrial geologists) insist the Quaternary to be a separate period of distinctly different record. The somewhat confusing terminology and disagreement amongst geologists on where to draw what hierarchical boundaries is due to the comparatively fine divisibility of time units as time approaches the present, and due to geological preservation that causes the youngest sedimentary geological record to be preserved over a much larger area and to reflect many more environments than the older geological record. [ 8 ] By dividing the Cenozoic Era into three (arguably two) periods ( Paleogene , Neogene, Quaternary ) instead of seven epochs, the periods are more closely comparable to the duration of periods in the Mesozoic and Paleozoic Eras. 

The International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) once proposed that the Quaternary be considered a sub-era (sub-erathem) of the Neogene, with a beginning date of 2.58 Ma, namely the start of the Gelasian Stage .  In the 2004 proposal of the ICS, the Neogene would have consisted of the Miocene and Pliocene Epochs. [ 28 ] The International Union for Quaternary Research (INQUA) counterproposed that the Neogene and the Pliocene end at 2.58 Ma, that the Gelasian be transferred to the Pleistocene, and the Quaternary be recognized as the third period in the Cenozoic, citing  key changes in Earth's climate, oceans, and biota that occurred 2.58 Ma and its correspondence to the Gauss-Matuyama magnetostratigraphic boundary . [ 29 ] [ 30 ] In 2006 ICS and INQUA reached a compromise that made Quaternary a sub-era, subdividing Cenozoic into the old classical Tertiary and Quaternary, a compromise that was rejected by International Union of Geological Sciences because it split both Neogene and Pliocene in two. [ 31 ] 

Following formal discussions at the 2008 International Geological Congress in Oslo, Norway, [ 32 ] the ICS decided in May 2009 to make the Quaternary the youngest period of the Cenozoic Era with its base at 2.58 Ma and including the Gelasian Age, which was formerly considered part of the Neogene Period and Pliocene Epoch. [ 33 ] Thus the Neogene Period ends bounding the succeeding Quaternary Period at 2.58 Ma.

The Holocene ( / ˈ h ɒ l . ə s iː n , - oʊ -, ˈ h oʊ . l ə -, - l oʊ -/ ) [ 3 ] [ 4 ] is the current geological epoch , beginning approximately 11,700 years ago. [ 5 ] It follows the Last Glacial Period , which concluded with the Holocene glacial retreat . [ 5 ] The Holocene and the preceding Pleistocene [ 6 ] together form the Quaternary period. The Holocene is an interglacial period within the ongoing glacial cycles of the Quaternary, and is equivalent to Marine Isotope Stage 1 . The name "Holocene" comes from Ancient Greek ὅλος ( hólos ), meaning "whole", and καινός ( kainós ), meaning "new, recent", referring that this epoch is "entirely new". 

The Holocene correlates with the last maximum axial tilt towards the Sun of the Earth's obliquity . The Holocene corresponds with the rapid proliferation, growth, and impacts of the human species worldwide, hence the Holocene is often commonly referred to as the Age of Humans , including all of its written history , technological revolutions , development of major civilizations , and overall significant transition towards urban living in the present. The human impact on modern-era Earth and its ecosystems may be considered of global significance for the future evolution of living species, including approximately synchronous lithospheric evidence, or more recently hydrospheric and atmospheric evidence of the human impact. 

Following the extinction of most large terrestrial mammals outside of Africa during the preceding Late Pleistocene , the ecosystems of the Holocene continued to be impacted by extinctions (the ongoing Holocene extinction ), largely of human causation. 

In July 2018, the International Union of Geological Sciences split the Holocene Epoch into three distinct ages based on the climate, Greenlandian (11,700 years ago to 8,200 years ago), Northgrippian (8,200 years ago to 4,200 years ago) and Meghalayan (4,200 years ago to the present), as proposed by the International Commission on Stratigraphy . [ 7 ] The oldest age, the Greenlandian, was characterized by a warming following the preceding ice age. The Northgrippian Age is known for vast cooling due to a disruption in ocean circulations that was caused by the melting of glaciers. The most recent age of the Holocene is the present Meghalayan, which began with extreme drought that lasted around 200 years. [ 7 ] 

# Etymology 
[ edit ] 

The word "Holocene" comes from Ancient Greek ὅλος ( hólos ), meaning "whole", and καινός ( kainós ), meaning "new, recent", referring that this epoch is "entirely new". [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] The suffix '-cene' is used for all the seven epochs of the Cenozoic Era. 

# Overview 
[ edit ] 

The International Commission on Stratigraphy has defined the Holocene as starting approximately 11,700 years before 2000 CE (11,650 cal years BP , or 9,700 BCE). [ 5 ] The Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy (SQS) regards the term 'recent' as an incorrect way of referring to the Holocene, preferring the term 'modern' instead to describe current processes. It also observes that the term 'Flandrian' may be used as a synonym for Holocene, although it is becoming outdated. [ 11 ] The International Commission on Stratigraphy, however, considers the Holocene to be an epoch following the Pleistocene and specifically following the last glacial period . Local names for the last glacial period include the Wisconsinan in North America , [ 12 ] the Weichselian in Europe, [ 13 ] the Devensian in Britain, [ 14 ] the Llanquihue in Chile [ 15 ] and the Otiran in New Zealand. [ 16 ] 

The Holocene can be subdivided into five time intervals, or chronozones , based on climatic fluctuations: [ 17 ] [ needs update? ] 

- Preboreal (10 ka–9 ka BP), 
- Boreal (9 ka–8 ka BP), 
- Atlantic (8 ka–5 ka BP), 
- Subboreal (5 ka–2.5 ka BP) and 
- Subatlantic (2.5 ka BP–present). Note: " ka BP" means "kilo-annum Before Present ", i.e. 1,000 years before 1950 (non-calibrated C14 dates ) 

Geologists working in different regions are studying sea levels, peat bogs, and ice-core samples, using a variety of methods, with a view toward further verifying and refining the Blytt–Sernander sequence . This is a classification of climatic periods initially defined by plant remains in peat mosses . [ 18 ] Though the method was once thought to be of little interest, based on 14 C dating of peats that was inconsistent with the claimed chronozones, [ 19 ] investigators have found a general correspondence across Eurasia and North America . The scheme was defined for Northern Europe , but the climate changes were claimed to occur more widely. The periods of the scheme include a few of the final pre-Holocene oscillations of the last glacial period and then classify climates of more recent prehistory . [ 20 ] 

Paleontologists have not defined any faunal stages for the Holocene. If subdivision is necessary, periods of human technological development, such as the Mesolithic , Neolithic , and Bronze Age , are usually used. However, the time periods referenced by these terms vary with the emergence of those technologies in different parts of the world. [ 21 ] 

Some scholars have argued that a third epoch of the Quaternary, the Anthropocene , has now begun. [ 22 ] This term has been used to denote the present time-interval in which many geologically significant conditions and processes have been profoundly altered by human activities. The 'Anthropocene' (a term coined by Paul J. Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer in 2000) was never a formally defined geological unit. The Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy (SQS) of the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) had a working group to determine whether it should be. In May 2019, members of the working group voted in favour of recognizing the Anthropocene as formal chrono-stratigraphic unit, with stratigraphic signals around the mid-twentieth century CE as its base. The exact criteria were still to be determined, after which the recommendation also had to be approved by the working group's parent bodies (ultimately the International Union of Geological Sciences ). [ 23 ] In March 2024, after 15 years of deliberation, the Anthropocene Epoch proposal of the working group was voted down by a wide margin by the SQS, owing largely to its shallow sedimentary record and extremely recent proposed start date. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] The ICS and the International Union of Geological Sciences later formally confirmed, by a near unanimous vote, the rejection of the working group's Anthropocene Epoch proposal for inclusion in the Geologic Time Scale. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] 

# Geology 
[ edit ] 

The Holocene is a geologic epoch that follows directly after the Pleistocene. Continental motions due to plate tectonics are less than a kilometre over a span of only 10,000 years. However, ice melt caused world sea levels to rise about 35 m (115 ft) in the early part of the Holocene and another 30 m in the later part of the Holocene. In addition, many areas above about 40 degrees north latitude had been depressed by the weight of the Pleistocene glaciers and rose as much as 180 m (590 ft) due to post-glacial rebound over the late Pleistocene and Holocene, and are still rising today. [ 29 ] 

The sea-level rise and temporary land depression allowed temporary marine incursions into areas that are now far from the sea. For example, marine fossils from the Holocene epoch have been found in locations such as Vermont and Michigan . Other than higher-latitude temporary marine incursions associated with glacial depression, Holocene fossils are found primarily in lakebed, floodplain , and cave deposits. Holocene marine deposits along low-latitude coastlines are rare because the rise in sea levels during the period exceeds any likely tectonic uplift of non-glacial origin. [ citation needed ] 

Post-glacial rebound in the Scandinavia region resulted in a shrinking Baltic Sea . The region continues to rise, still causing weak earthquakes across Northern Europe. An equivalent event in North America was the rebound of Hudson Bay , as it shrank from its larger, immediate post-glacial Tyrrell Sea phase, to its present boundaries. [ 30 ] 

# Climate 
[ edit ] 
Vegetation and water bodies in northern and central Africa in the Eemian (bottom) and Holocene (top) 

The climate throughout the Holocene has shown significant variability despite ice core records from Greenland suggesting a more stable climate following the preceding ice age. Marine chemical fluxes during the Holocene were lower than during the Younger Dryas, but were still considerable enough to imply notable changes in the climate. 

The temporal and spatial extent of climate change during the Holocene is an area of considerable uncertainty, with radiative forcing recently proposed to be the origin of cycles identified in the North Atlantic region. Climate cyclicity through the Holocene ( Bond events ) has been observed in or near marine settings and is strongly controlled by glacial input to the North Atlantic. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] Periodicities of ≈2500, ≈1500, and ≈1000 years are generally observed in the North Atlantic. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] At the same time spectral analyses of the continental record, which is remote from oceanic influence, reveal persistent periodicities of 1,000 and 500 years that may correspond to solar activity variations during the Holocene Epoch. [ 36 ] A 1,500-year cycle corresponding to the North Atlantic oceanic circulation may have had widespread global distribution in the Late Holocene. [ 36 ] From 8,500 BP to 6,700 BP, North Atlantic climate oscillations were highly irregular and erratic because of perturbations from substantial ice discharge into the ocean from the collapsing Laurentide Ice Sheet. [ 37 ] The Greenland ice core records indicate that climate changes became more regional and had a larger effect on the mid-to-low latitudes and mid-to-high latitudes after ~5600 B.P. [ 38 ] 

Human activity through land use changes already by the Mesolithic had major ecological impacts; [ 39 ] it was an important influence on Holocene climatic changes, and is believed to be why the Holocene is an atypical interglacial that has not experienced significant cooling over its course. [ 40 ] From the start of the Industrial Revolution onwards, large-scale anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions caused the Earth to warm. [ 41 ] Likewise, climatic changes have induced substantial changes in human civilisation over the course of the Holocene. [ 42 ] [ 43 ] 

During the transition from the last glacial to the Holocene, the Huelmo–Mascardi Cold Reversal in the Southern Hemisphere began before the Younger Dryas, and the maximum warmth flowed south to north from 11,000 to 7,000 years ago. It appears that this was influenced by the residual glacial ice remaining in the Northern Hemisphere until the later date. [ citation needed ] The first major phase of Holocene climate was the Preboreal . [ 44 ] At the start of the Preboreal occurred the Preboreal Oscillation (PBO). [ 45 ] The Holocene Climatic Optimum (HCO) was a period of warming throughout the globe but was not globally synchronous and uniform. [ 46 ] Following the HCO, the global climate entered a broad trend of very gradual cooling known as Neoglaciation , which lasted from the end of the HCO to before the Industrial Revolution . [ 44 ] From the 10th-14th century, the climate was similar to that of modern times during a period known as the Mediaeval Warm Period (MWP), also known as the Mediaeval Climatic Optimum (MCO). It was found that the warming that is taking place in current years is both more frequent and more spatially homogeneous than what was experienced during the MWP. A warming of +1 degree Celsius occurs 5–40 times more frequently in modern years than during the MWP. The major forcing during the MWP was due to greater solar activity, which led to heterogeneity compared to the greenhouse gas forcing of modern years that leads to more homogeneous warming. This was followed by the Little Ice Age (LIA) from the 13th or 14th century to the mid-19th century. [ 47 ] The LIA was the coldest interval of time of the past two millennia. [ 48 ] Following the Industrial Revolution, warm decadal intervals became more common relative to before as a consequence of anthropogenic greenhouse gases, resulting in progressive global warming. [ 41 ] In the late 20th century, anthropogenic forcing superseded variations in solar activity as the dominant driver of climate change, [ 49 ] though solar activity has continued to play a role. [ 50 ] [ 51 ] 

# Europe

Drangajökull , Iceland's northernmost glacier, melted shortly after 9,200 BP. [ 52 ] In Northern Germany , the Middle Holocene saw a drastic increase in the amount of raised bogs, most likely related to sea level rise. Although human activity affected geomorphology and landscape evolution in Northern Germany throughout the Holocene, it only became a dominant influence in the last four centuries. [ 53 ] In the French Alps , geochemistry and lithium isotope signatures in lake sediments have suggested gradual soil formation from the Last Glacial Period to the Holocene climatic optimum , and this soil development was altered by the settlement of human societies. Early anthropogenic activities such as deforestation and agriculture reinforced soil erosion, which peaked in the Middle Ages at an unprecedented level, marking human forcing as the most powerful factor affecting surface processes. [ 54 ] The sedimentary record from Aitoliko Lagoon indicates that wet winters locally predominated from 210 to 160 BP, followed by dry winter dominance from 160 to 20 BP. [ 55 ] 

# Africa 
[ edit ] 

North Africa, dominated by the Sahara Desert in the present, was instead a savanna dotted with large lakes during the Early and Middle Holocene, [ 56 ] regionally known as the African Humid Period (AHP). [ 57 ] The northward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) produced increased monsoon rainfall over North Africa. [ 58 ] The lush vegetation of the Sahara brought an increase in pastoralism . [ 59 ] The AHP ended around 5,500 BP, after which the Sahara began to dry and become the desert it is today. [ 60 ] 

A stronger East African Monsoon during the Middle Holocene increased precipitation in East Africa and raised lake levels. [ 61 ] Around 800 AD, or 1,150 BP, a marine transgression occurred in southeastern Africa; in the Lake Lungué basin, this sea level highstand occurred from 740 to 910 AD, or from 1,210 to 1,040 BP, as evidenced by the lake's connection to the Indian Ocean at this time. This transgression was followed by a period of transition that lasted until 590 BP, when the region experienced significant aridification and began to be extensively used by humans for livestock herding. [ 62 ] 

In the Kalahari Desert , Holocene climate was overall very stable and environmental change was of low amplitude. Relatively cool conditions have prevailed since 4,000 BP. [ 63 ] 

# Middle East 
[ edit ] 
A model of Çatalhöyük , a commonly cited example of a proto-city , 7300 BC 

In the Middle East , the Holocene brought a warmer and wetter climate, in contrast to the preceding cold, dry Younger Dryas . The Early Holocene saw the advent and spread of agriculture in the Fertile Crescent — sheep , goat , cattle , and later pig were domesticated, as well as cereals, like wheat and barley , and legumes —which would later disperse into much of the world. This ' Neolithic Revolution ', likely influenced by Holocene climatic changes, included an increase in sedentism and population, eventually resulting in the world's first large-scale state societies in Mesopotamia and Egypt . [ 64 ] 

During the Middle Holocene, the Intertropical Convergence Zone , which governs the incursion of monsoon precipitation through the Arabian Peninsula , shifted southwards, resulting in increased aridity. [ 65 ] In the Middle to Late Holocene, the coastline of the Levant and Persian Gulf receded, prompting a shift in human settlement patterns following this marine regression. [ 66 ] 

# Central Asia 
[ edit ] 

Central Asia experienced glacial-like temperatures until about 8,000 BP, when the Laurentide Ice Sheet collapsed. [ 67 ] In Xinjiang , long-term Holocene warming increased meltwater supply during summers, creating large lakes and oases at low altitudes and inducing enhanced moisture recycling. [ 68 ] In the Tien Shan , sedimentological evidence from Swan Lake suggests the period between 8,500 and 6,900 BP was relatively warm, with steppe meadow vegetation being predominant. An increase in Cyperaceae from 6,900 to 2,600 BP indicates cooling and humidification of the Tian Shan climate that was interrupted by a warm period between 5,500 and 4,500 BP. After 2,600 BP, an alpine steppe climate prevailed across the region. [ 69 ] Sand dune evolution in the Bayanbulak Basin shows that the region was very dry from the Holocene's beginning until around 6,500 BP, when a wet interval began. [ 70 ] In the Tibetan Plateau , the moisture optimum spanned from around 7,500 to 5,500 BP. [ 71 ] The Tarim Basin records the onset of significant aridification around 3,000-2,000 BP. [ 72 ] 

# South Asia 
[ edit ] 

After 11,800 BP, and especially between 10,800 and 9,200 BP, Ladakh experienced tremendous moisture increase most likely related to the strengthening of the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM). From 9,200 to 6,900 BP, relative aridity persisted in Ladakh. A second major humid phase occurred in Ladakh from 6,900 to 4,800 BP, after which the region was again arid. [ 73 ] 

From 900 to 1,200 AD, during the MWP, the ISM was again strong as evidenced by low δ 18 O values from the Ganga Plain. [ 74 ] 

The sediments of Lonar Lake in Maharashtra record dry conditions around 11,400 BP that transitioned into a much wetter climate from 11,400 to 11,100 BP due to intensification of the ISM. Over the Early Holocene, the region was very wet, but during the Middle Holocene from 6,200 to 3,900 BP, aridification occurred, with the subsequent Late Holocene being relatively arid as a whole. [ 75 ] 

Coastal southwestern India experienced a stronger ISM from 9,690 to 7,560 BP, during the HCO. From 3,510 to 2,550 BP, during the Late Holocene, the ISM became weaker, although this weakening was interrupted by an interval of unusually high ISM strength from 3,400 to 3,200 BP. [ 76 ] 

# East Asia 
[ edit ] 

Southwestern China experienced long-term warming during the Early Holocene up until ~7,000 BP. [ 77 ] Northern China experienced an abrupt aridification event approximately 4,000 BP. [ 78 ] From around 3,500 to 3,000 BP, northeastern China underwent a prolonged cooling, manifesting itself with the disruption of Bronze Age civilisations in the region. [ 79 ] Eastern and southern China, the monsoonal regions of China, were wetter than present in the Early and Middle Holocene. [ 80 ] Lake Huguangyan's TOC, δ 13 C wax , δ 13 C org , δ 15 N values suggest the period of peak moisture lasted from 9,200 to 1,800 BP and was attributable to a strong East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM). [ 81 ] Late Holocene cooling events in the region were dominantly influenced by solar forcing, with many individual cold snaps linked to solar minima such as the Oort, Wolf , Spörer , and Maunder Minima . [ 82 ] A notable cooling event in southeastern China occurred 3,200 BP. [ 83 ] Strengthening of the winter monsoon occurred around 5,500, 4,000, and 2,500 BP. [ 84 ] Monsoonal regions of China became more arid in the Late Holocene. [ 80 ] 

In the Sea of Japan, the Middle Holocene was notable for its warmth, with rhythmic temperature fluctuations every 400–500 and 1,000 years. [ 85 ] 

# Southeast Asia 
[ edit ] 

Before 7,500 BP, the Gulf of Thailand was exposed above sea level and was very arid. A marine transgression occurred from 7,500 to 6,200 BP amidst global warming. [ 86 ] 

# North America 
[ edit ] 

During the Middle Holocene, western North America was drier than present, with wetter winters and drier summers. [ 87 ] After the end of the thermal maximum of the HCO around 4,500 BP, the East Greenland Current underwent strengthening. [ 88 ] A massive megadrought occurred from 2,800 to 1,850 BP in the Great Basin . [ 89 ] 

Eastern North America underwent abrupt warming and humidification around 10,500 BP and then declined from 9,300 to 9,100 BP. The region has undergone a long term wettening since 5,500 BP occasionally interrupted by intervals of high aridity. A major cool event lasting from 5,500 to 4,700 BP was coeval with a major humidification before being terminated by a major drought and warming at the end of that interval. [ 90 ] 

# South America 
[ edit ] 

During the Early Holocene, relative sea level rose in the Bahia region, causing a landward expansion of mangroves. During the Late Holocene, the mangroves declined as sea level dropped and freshwater supply increased. [ 91 ] In the Santa Catarina region, the maximum sea level highstand was around 2.1 metres above present and occurred about 5,800 to 5,000 BP. [ 92 ] Sea levels at Rocas Atoll were likewise higher than present for much of the Late Holocene. [ 93 ] 

# Australia 
[ edit ] 

The Northwest Australian Summer Monsoon was in a strong phase from 8,500 to 6,400 BP, from 5,000 to 4,000 BP (possibly until 3,000 BP), and from 1,300 to 900 BP, with weak phases in between and the current weak phase beginning around 900 BP after the end of the last strong phase. [ 94 ] 

# New Zealand 
[ edit ] 

Ice core measurements imply that the sea surface temperature (SST) gradient east of New Zealand, across the subtropical front (STF), was around 2 degrees Celsius during the HCO. This temperature gradient is significantly less than modern times, which is around 6 degrees Celsius. A study utilizing five SST proxies from 37°S to 60°S latitude confirmed that the strong temperature gradient was confined to the area immediately south of the STF, and is correlated with reduced westerly winds near New Zealand. [ 95 ] Since 7,100 BP, New Zealand experienced 53 cyclones similar in magnitude to Cyclone Bola . [ 96 ] 

# Pacific 
[ edit ] 

Evidence from the Galápagos Islands shows that the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was significantly weaker during the Middle Holocene, but that the strength of ENSO became moderate to high over the Late Holocene. [ 97 ] 

# Ecological developments 
[ edit ] 

The decimation of terrestrial megafauna species outside of Africa during the preceding 40,000 years (the Late Pleistocene megafauna extinctions ), likely as a result of climate change, human hunting, or a combination of both, including in the extinction of over half of all megafauna species, left Holocene ecosystems highly altered and depauperate at their highest trophic levels compared to those in the preceding Pleistocene. [ 98 ] Megafauna losses continued during the early-mid Holocene, with the Irish elk ( Megaloceros giganteus , also known as the giant deer) surviving until around 7,700 years ago in western Russia, [ 99 ] with woolly mammoths ( Mammuthus primigenius ) surviving in mainland Siberia until around 10,000 years ago, [ 100 ] with a small population on Wrangel Island surviving until around 4,000 years ago. [ 101 ] 

Throughout the world, ecosystems in cooler climates that were previously regional have been isolated in higher altitude ecological "islands". [ 102 ] 
Stages of proglacial lake development in the region of the current North American Great Lakes 

The 8.2-ka event , an abrupt cold spell recorded as a negative excursion in the δ 18 O record lasting 400 years, is the most prominent climatic event occurring in the Holocene Epoch, and may have marked a resurgence of ice cover. It has been suggested that this event was caused by the final drainage of Lake Agassiz , which had been confined by the glaciers, disrupting the thermohaline circulation of the Atlantic . [ 103 ] This disruption was the result of an ice dam over Hudson Bay collapsing sending cold lake Agassiz water into the North Atlantic ocean . [ 104 ] Furthermore, studies show that the melting of Lake Agassiz led to sea-level rise which flooded the North American coastal landscape. The basal peat plant was then used to determine the resulting local sea-level rise of 0.20-0.56m in the Mississippi Delta . [ 104 ] Subsequent research, however, suggested that the discharge was probably superimposed upon a longer episode of cooler climate lasting up to 600 years and observed that the extent of the area affected was unclear.

The beginning of the Holocene corresponds with the beginning of the Mesolithic age in most of Europe . In regions such as the Middle East and Anatolia , the term Epipaleolithic is preferred in place of Mesolithic, as they refer to approximately the same time period. Cultures in this period include Hamburgian , Federmesser , and the Natufian culture , during which the oldest inhabited places still existing on Earth were first settled, such as Tell es-Sultan (Jericho) in the Middle East . [ 106 ] There is also evolving archeological evidence of proto-religion at locations such as Göbekli Tepe , as long ago as the 9th millennium BC . [ 107 ] 

The preceding period of the Late Pleistocene had already brought advancements such as the bow and arrow , creating more efficient forms of hunting and replacing spear throwers . In the Holocene, however, the domestication of plants and animals allowed humans to develop villages and towns in centralized locations. Archaeological data shows that between 10,000 and 7,000 BP rapid domestication of plants and animals took place in tropical and subtropical parts of Asia , Africa , and Central America . [ 108 ] The development of farming allowed humans to transition away from hunter-gatherer nomadic cultures, which did not establish permanent settlements, to a more sustainable sedentary lifestyle . This form of lifestyle change allowed humans to develop towns and villages in centralized locations, which gave rise to the world known today. It is believed that the domestication of plants and animals began in the early part of the Holocene in the tropical areas of the planet. [ 108 ] Because these areas had warm, moist temperatures, the climate was perfect for effective farming. Culture development and human population change, specifically in South America, has also been linked to spikes in hydroclimate resulting in climate variability in the mid-Holocene (8.2–4.2 k cal BP). [ 109 ] Climate change on seasonality and available moisture also allowed for favorable agricultural conditions which promoted human development for Maya and Tiwanaku regions. [ 110 ] In the Korean Peninsula , climatic changes fostered a population boom during the Middle Chulmun period from 5,500 to 5,000 BP, but contributed to a subsequent bust during the Late and Final Chulmun periods, from 5,000 to 4,000 BP and from 4,000 to 3,500 BP respectively. [ 111 ] 

# Extinction event 
[ edit ] 

Main article: Holocene extinction 

The Holocene extinction , otherwise referred to as the sixth mass extinction or Anthropocene extinction , [ 112 ] [ 113 ] is an ongoing extinction event of species during the present Holocene epoch (with the more recent time sometimes called Anthropocene) as a result of human activity . [ 114 ] [ 115 ] [ 116 ] [ 117 ] The included extinctions span numerous families of fungi , [ 118 ] plants , [ 119 ] [ 120 ] and animals , including mammals , birds , reptiles , amphibians , fish and invertebrates . With widespread degradation of highly biodiverse habitats such as coral reefs and rainforests , as well as other areas, the vast majority of these extinctions are thought to be undocumented, as the species are undiscovered at the time of their extinction, or no one has yet discovered their extinction. The current rate of extinction of species is estimated at 100 to 1,000 times higher than natural background extinction rates . [ 115 ] [ 104 ] [ 121 ] [ 122 ]

The conservation status of a group of organisms (for instance, a species ) indicates whether the group still exists and how likely the group is to become extinct in the near future . Many factors are taken into account when assessing conservation status: not simply the number of individuals remaining, but the overall increase or decrease in the population over time, breeding success rates , and known threats. Various systems of conservation status are in use at international, multi-country, national and local levels, as well as for consumer use such as sustainable seafood advisory lists and certification . The two international systems are by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) . 

# International systems 
[ edit ] 

# IUCN Red List of Threatened Species 
[ edit ] 

The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature is the best known worldwide conservation status listing and ranking system. Species are classified by the IUCN Red List into nine groups set through criteria such as rate of decline, population size, area of geographic distribution, and degree of population and distribution fragmentation. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] 

Also included are species that have gone extinct since 1500 CE. [ 3 ] When discussing the IUCN Red List, the official term " threatened " is a grouping of three categories: critically endangered, endangered, and vulnerable. 

- Extinct (EX) – There are no known living individuals 
- Extinct in the wild (EW) – Known only to survive in captivity, or as a naturalized population outside its historic range 
- Critically Endangered (CR) – Highest risk of extinction in the wild 
- Endangered (EN) – Higher risk of extinction in the wild 
- Vulnerable (VU) – High risk of extinction in the wild 
- Near Threatened (NT) – Likely to become endangered in the near future 
- Conservation Dependent (CD) – Low risk; is conserved to prevent being near threatened, certain events may lead it to being a higher risk level 
- Least concern (LC) – Very low risk; does not qualify for a higher risk category and not likely to be threatened in the near future. Widespread and abundant taxa are included in this category. 
- Data deficient (DD) – Not enough data to make an assessment of its risk of extinction 
- Not evaluated (NE) – Has not yet been evaluated against the criteria. 

# The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora 
[ edit ] 

The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) went into force in 1975. It aims to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival. Many countries require CITES permits when importing plants and animals listed on CITES. 

# Multi-country systems 
[ edit ] 

In the European Union (EU), the Birds Directive and Habitats Directive are the legal instruments which evaluate the conservation status within the EU of species and habitats. 

NatureServe conservation status focuses on Latin America , the United States, Canada, and the Caribbean . It has been developed by scientists from NatureServe , The Nature Conservancy , and a network of natural heritage programs and data centers. It is increasingly integrated with the IUCN Red List system. Its categories for species include: presumed extinct (GX), possibly extinct (GH), critically imperiled (G1), imperiled (G2), vulnerable (G3), apparently secure (G4), and secure (G5). [ 4 ] The system also allows ambiguous or uncertain ranks including inexact numeric ranks (e.g. G2?), and range ranks (e.g. G2G3) for when the exact rank is uncertain. NatureServe adds a qualifier for captive or cultivated only (C), which has a similar meaning to the IUCN Red List extinct in the wild (EW) status. 

The Red Data Book of the Russian Federation is used within the Russian Federation, and also accepted in parts of Africa. 

# National systems 
[ edit ] 

In Australia, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) describes lists of threatened species, ecological communities and threatening processes. The categories resemble those of the 1994 IUCN Red List Categories & Criteria (version 2.3). Prior to the EPBC Act, a simpler classification system was used by the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992 . Some state and territory governments also have their own systems for conservation status. The codes for the Western Australian conservation system are given at Declared Rare and Priority Flora List (abbreviated to DECF when using in a taxobox). 

In Belgium, the Flemish Research Institute for Nature and Forest publishes an online set of more than 150 nature indicators in Dutch. [ 5 ] 

In Canada, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) is a group of experts that assesses and designates which wild species are in some danger of disappearing from Canada. [ 6 ] Under the Species at Risk Act (SARA), it is up to the federal government, which is politically accountable, to legally protect species assessed by COSEWIC. 

In China, the State, provinces and some counties have determined their key protected wildlife species. There is the China red data book. 

In Finland , many species are protected under the Nature Conservation Act, and through the EU Habitats Directive and EU Birds Directive. [ 7 ] 

In Germany, the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation publishes "red lists of endangered species". 

India has the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, Amended 2003 and the Biological Diversity Act, 2002 . 

In Japan, the Ministry of Environment publishes a Threatened Wildlife of Japan Red Data Book. [ 8 ] 

In the Netherlands , the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality publishes a list of threatened species, and conservation is enforced by the Nature Conservation Act 1998. Species are also protected through the Wild Birds and Habitats Directives. 

In New Zealand, the Department of Conservation publishes the New Zealand Threat Classification System lists.  As of January 2008 [update] threatened species or subspecies are assigned one of seven categories: Nationally Critical, Nationally Endangered, Nationally Vulnerable, Declining, Recovering, Relict, or Naturally Uncommon. [ 9 ] While the classification looks only at a national level, many species are unique to New Zealand, and species which are secure overseas are noted as such. 

In Russia, the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation came out in 2001, it contains categories defining preservation status for different species. In it there are 8 taxa of amphibians, 21 taxa of reptiles, 128 taxa of birds, and 74 taxa of mammals, in total 231. There are also more than 30 regional red books, for example the red book of the Altaic region which came out in 1994. 

In South Africa , the South African National Biodiversity Institute , established under the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act, 2004, [ 10 ] is responsible for drawing up lists of affected species, and monitoring compliance with CITES decisions. It is envisaged that previously diverse Red lists would be more easily kept current, both technically and financially. 

In Thailand , the Wild Animal Reservation and Protection Act of BE 2535 defines fifteen reserved animal species and two classes of protected species, of which hunting, breeding, possession, and trade are prohibited or restricted by law. The National Park, Wildlife and Plant Conservation Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment is responsible for the regulation of these activities. 

In Ukraine , the Ministry of Environment Protection maintains list of endangered species (divided into seven categories from "0" - extinct to "VI" - rehabilitated) and publishes it in the Red Book of Ukraine. 

In the United States of America , the Endangered Species Act of 1973 created the Endangered Species List . 

# Consumer guides 
[ edit ] 

Main article: Sustainable seafood advisory lists and certification 

Some consumer guides for seafood , such as Seafood Watch , divide fish and other sea creatures into three categories, analogous to conservation status categories: 

- Red (" say no " or " avoid ") 
- Yellow or orange (" think twice ", " good alternatives " or " some concerns ") 
- Green (" best seafood choices ") [ 11 ] 

The categories do not simply reflect the imperilment of individual species, but also consider the environmental impacts of how and where they are fished, such as through bycatch or ocean bottom trawlers . Often groups of species are assessed rather than individual species (e.g. squid , prawns ). 

The Marine Conservation Society has five levels of ratings for seafood species, as displayed on their FishOnline website. [ 12 ]

In biology , taxonomy (from Ancient Greek τάξις ( taxis ) ' arrangement ' and -νομία ( -nomia ) ' method ' ) is the scientific study of naming, defining ( circumscribing ) and classifying groups of biological organisms based on shared characteristics. Organisms are grouped into taxa (singular: taxon), and these groups are given a taxonomic rank ; groups of a given rank can be aggregated to form a more inclusive group of higher rank, thus creating a taxonomic hierarchy. The principal ranks in modern use are domain , kingdom , phylum ( division is sometimes used in botany in place of phylum ), class , order , family , genus , and species . The Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus is regarded as the founder of the current system of taxonomy, having developed a ranked system known as Linnaean taxonomy for categorizing organisms. 

With advances in the theory, data and analytical technology of biological systematics, the Linnaean system has transformed into a system of modern biological classification intended to reflect the evolutionary relationships among organisms, both living and extinct. 

# Definition 

The exact definition of taxonomy varies from source to source, but the core of the discipline remains: the conception, naming, and classification of groups of organisms. [ 1 ] As points of reference, recent definitions of taxonomy are presented below: 

- Theory and practice of grouping individuals into species, arranging species into larger groups, and giving those groups names, thus producing a classification. [ 2 ] 
- A field of science (and a major component of systematics ) that encompasses description, identification, nomenclature , and classification [ 3 ] 
- The science of classification, in biology the arrangement of organisms into a classification [ 4 ] 
- "The science of classification as applied to living organisms, including the study of means of formation of species, etc." [ 5 ] 
- "The analysis of an organism's characteristics for the purpose of classification" [ 6 ] 
- "Systematics studies phylogeny to provide a pattern that can be translated into the classification and names of the more inclusive field of taxonomy" (listed as a desirable but unusual definition) [ 7 ] 

The varied definitions either place taxonomy as a sub-area of systematics (definition 2), invert that relationship (definition 6), or appear to consider the two terms synonymous. There is some disagreement as to whether biological nomenclature is considered a part of taxonomy (definitions 1 and 2), or a part of systematics outside taxonomy. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] For example, definition 6 is paired with the following definition of systematics that places nomenclature outside taxonomy: [ 6 ] 

- Systematics : "The study of the identification, taxonomy, and nomenclature of organisms, including the classification of living things with regard to their natural relationships and the study of variation and the evolution of taxa". 

In 1970, Michener et al. defined "systematic biology" and "taxonomy" in relation to one another as follows: [ 10 ] 

Systematic biology (hereafter called simply systematics) is the field that 

- (a) provides scientific names for organisms, 
- (b) describes them, 
- (c) preserves collections of them, 
- (d) provides classifications for the organisms, keys for their identification, and data on their distributions, 
- (e) investigates their evolutionary histories, and 
- (f) considers their environmental adaptations. 

This is a field with a long history that in recent years has experienced a notable renaissance, principally with respect to theoretical content. Part of the theoretical material has to do with evolutionary areas (topics e and f above), the rest relates especially to the problem of classification. Taxonomy is that part of Systematics concerned with topics (a) to (d) above. 

A whole set of terms including taxonomy, systematic biology, systematics , scientific classification, biological classification, and phylogenetics have at times had overlapping meanings – sometimes the same, sometimes slightly different, but always related and intersecting. [ 1 ] [ 11 ] The broadest meaning of "taxonomy" is used here. The term itself was introduced in 1813 by de Candolle , in his Théorie élémentaire de la botanique . [ 12 ] John Lindley provided an early definition of systematics in 1830, although he wrote of "systematic botany" rather than using the term "systematics". [ 1 ] Europeans tend to use the terms "systematics" and "biosystematics" for the study of biodiversity as a whole, whereas North Americans tend to use "taxonomy" more frequently. [ 13 ] However, taxonomy, and in particular alpha taxonomy, is more specifically the identification, description, and naming (i.e., nomenclature) of organisms, [ 14 ] while "classification" focuses on placing organisms within hierarchical groups that show their relationships to other organisms. 

# Monograph and taxonomic revision 

A taxonomic revision or taxonomic review is a novel analysis of the variation patterns in a particular taxon . This analysis may be executed on the basis of any combination of the various available kinds of characters, such as morphological, anatomical , palynological , biochemical and genetic . A monograph or complete revision is a revision that is comprehensive for a taxon for the information given at a particular time, and for the entire world. Other (partial) revisions may be restricted in the sense that they may only use some of the available character sets or have a limited spatial scope. A revision results in a conformation of or new insights in the relationships between the subtaxa within the taxon under study, which may lead to a change in the classification of these subtaxa, the identification of new subtaxa, or the merger of previous subtaxa. [ 15 ] 

# Taxonomic characters 

Taxonomic characters are the taxonomic attributes that can be used to provide the evidence from which relationships (the phylogeny ) between taxa are inferred. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Kinds of taxonomic characters include: [ 18 ] 

- Morphological characters 
- General external morphology 
- Special structures (e.g., genitalia ) 
- Internal morphology ( anatomy ) 
- Embryology 
- Karyology and other cytological factors 
- Physiological characters 
- Metabolic factors 
- Body secretions 
- Genic sterility factors 
- Molecular characters 
- Immunological distance

# Alpha and beta taxonomy 

Not to be confused with Alpha diversity . 

The term " alpha taxonomy " is primarily used to refer to the discipline of finding, describing, and naming taxa , particularly species. [ 19 ] In earlier literature, the term had a different meaning, referring to morphological taxonomy, and the products of research through the end of the 19th century. [ 20 ] 

William Bertram Turrill introduced the term "alpha taxonomy" in a series of papers published in 1935 and 1937 in which he discussed the philosophy and possible future directions of the discipline of taxonomy. [ 21 ] 

... there is an increasing desire amongst taxonomists to consider their problems from wider viewpoints, to investigate the possibilities of closer co-operation with their cytological, ecological and genetics colleagues and to acknowledge that some revision or expansion, perhaps of a drastic nature, of their aims and methods, may be desirable ... Turrill (1935) has suggested that while accepting the older invaluable taxonomy, based on structure, and conveniently designated "alpha", it is possible to glimpse a far-distant taxonomy built upon as wide a basis of morphological and physiological facts as possible, and one in which "place is found for all observational and experimental data relating, even if indirectly, to the constitution, subdivision, origin, and behaviour of species and other taxonomic groups". Ideals can, it may be said, never be completely realized. They have, however, a great value of acting as permanent stimulants, and if we have some, even vague, ideal of an "omega" taxonomy we may progress a little way down the Greek alphabet. Some of us please ourselves by thinking we are now groping in a "beta" taxonomy. [ 21 ] 

Turrill thus explicitly excludes from alpha taxonomy various areas of study that he includes within taxonomy as a whole, such as ecology, physiology, genetics, and cytology. He further excludes phylogenetic reconstruction from alpha taxonomy. [ 22 ] 

Later authors have used the term in a different sense, to mean the delimitation of species (not subspecies or taxa of other ranks), using whatever investigative techniques are available, and including sophisticated computational or laboratory techniques. [ 23 ] [ 19 ] Thus, Ernst Mayr in 1968 defined " beta taxonomy " as the classification of ranks higher than species. [ 24 ] 

An understanding of the biological meaning of variation and of the evolutionary origin of groups of related species is even more important for the second stage of taxonomic activity, the sorting of species into groups of relatives ("taxa") and their arrangement in a hierarchy of higher categories. This activity is what the term classification denotes; it is also referred to as "beta taxonomy". 

# Microtaxonomy and macrotaxonomy 

Main article: Species problem 

How species should be defined in a particular group of organisms gives rise to practical and theoretical problems that are referred to as the species problem . The scientific work of deciding how to define species has been called microtaxonomy. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 19 ] By extension, macrotaxonomy is the study of groups at the higher taxonomic ranks subgenus and above, [ 19 ] or simply in clades that include more than one taxon considered a species, expressed in terms of phylogenetic nomenclature . [ 27 ] 

# History 

While some descriptions of taxonomic history attempt to date taxonomy to ancient civilizations, a truly scientific attempt to classify organisms did not occur until the 18th century, with the possible exception of Aristotle, whose works hint at a taxonomy. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] Earlier works were primarily descriptive and focused on plants that were useful in agriculture or medicine. 

There are a number of stages in this scientific thinking. Early taxonomy was based on arbitrary criteria, the so-called "artificial systems", including Linnaeus 's system of sexual classification for plants (Linnaeus's 1735 classification of animals was entitled " Systema Naturae " ("the System of Nature"), implying that he, at least, believed that it was more than an "artificial system"). 

Later came systems based on a more complete consideration of the characteristics of taxa, referred to as "natural systems", such as those of de Jussieu (1789), de Candolle (1813) and Bentham and Hooker (1862–1863). These classifications described empirical patterns and were pre- evolutionary in thinking. 

The publication of Charles Darwin 's On the Origin of Species (1859) led to a new explanation for classifications, based on evolutionary relationships. This was the concept of phyletic systems, from 1883 onwards. This approach was typified by those of Eichler (1883) and Engler (1886–1892). 

The advent of cladistic methodology in the 1970s led to classifications based on the sole criterion of monophyly , supported by the presence of synapomorphies . Since then, the evidentiary basis has been expanded with data from molecular genetics that for the most part complements traditional morphology . [ 30 ] [ page needed ] [ 31 ] [ page needed ] [ 32 ] [ page needed ] 

# Pre-Linnaean 

# Early taxonomists 

Naming and classifying human surroundings likely began with the onset of language. Distinguishing poisonous plants from edible plants is integral to the survival of human communities. Medicinal plant illustrations show up in Egyptian wall paintings from c. 1500 BC , indicating that the uses of different species were understood and that a basic taxonomy was in place. [ 33 ] 

# Ancient times 

Further information: Aristotle's biology § Classification 
Description of rare animals (写生珍禽图), by Song dynasty painter Huang Quan (903–965) 

Organisms were first classified by Aristotle ( Greece , 384–322 BC) during his stay on the island of Lesbos . [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] He classified beings by their parts, or in modern terms attributes , such as having live birth, having four legs, laying eggs, having blood, or being warm-bodied. [ 37 ] He divided all living things into two groups: plants and animals . [ 35 ] 

Some of his groups of animals, such as Anhaima (animals without blood, translated as invertebrates ) and Enhaima (animals with blood, roughly the vertebrates ), as well as groups like the sharks and cetaceans , are commonly used. [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] 

His student Theophrastus (Greece, 370–285 BC) carried on this tradition, mentioning some 500 plants and their uses in his Historia Plantarum . Several plant genera can be traced back to Theophrastus, such as Cornus , Crocus , and Narcissus . [ 35 ] 

# Medieval 

Taxonomy in the Middle Ages was largely based on the Aristotelian system , [ 37 ] with additions concerning the philosophical and existential order of creatures. This included concepts such as the great chain of being in the Western scholastic tradition, [ 37 ] again deriving ultimately from Aristotle. 

The Aristotelian system did not classify plants or fungi , due to the lack of microscopes at the time, [ 36 ] as his ideas were based on arranging the complete world in a single continuum, as per the scala naturae (the Natural Ladder). [ 35 ] This, as well, was taken into consideration in the great chain of being. [ 35 ] 

Advances were made by scholars such as Procopius , Timotheus of Gaza , Demetrios Pepagomenos , and Thomas Aquinas . Medieval thinkers used abstract philosophical and logical categorizations more suited to abstract philosophy than to pragmatic taxonomy. [ 35 ] In the Muslim world, Al-Damiri (d. 1405) wrote an influential work called Life of Animals ( Ḥayāt al-ḥayawān al-kubrā , c. 1371) which treats in alphabetic order of 931 animals mentioned in the Quran , the traditions and the poetic and proverbial literature of the Arabs. [ 41 ] 

# Renaissance and early modern 

During the Renaissance and the Age of Enlightenment , categorizing organisms became more prevalent, [ 35 ] and taxonomic works became ambitious enough to replace the ancient texts. This is sometimes credited to the development of sophisticated optical lenses, which allowed the morphology of organisms to be studied in much greater detail. 

One of the earliest authors to take advantage of this leap in technology was the Italian physician Andrea Cesalpino (1519–1603), who has been called "the first taxonomist". [ 42 ] His magnum opus De Plantis came out in 1583, and described more than 1,500 plant species. [ 43 ] [ 44 ] Two large plant families that he first recognized are in use: the Asteraceae and Brassicaceae . [ 45 ] 

In the 17th century, John Ray ( England , 1627–1705) wrote many important taxonomic works. [ 36 ] Arguably his greatest accomplishment was Methodus Plantarum Nova (1682), [ 46 ] in which he published details of over 18,000 plant species. At the time, his classifications were perhaps the most complex yet produced by any taxonomist, as he based his taxa on many combined characters. 

The next major taxonomic works were produced by Joseph Pitton de Tournefort (France, 1656–1708). [ 47 ] His work from 1700, Institutiones Rei Herbariae , included more than 9,000 species in 698 genera, which directly influenced Linnaeus, as it was the text he used as a young student. [ 33 ] 

# Linnaean era 

Main article: Linnaean taxonomy 
Title page of Systema Naturae , Leiden, 1735 

The Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778) [ 37 ] ushered in a new era of taxonomy. With his major works Systema Naturae 1st Edition in 1735, [ 48 ] Species Plantarum in 1753, [ 49 ] and Systema Naturae 10th Edition , [ 50 ] he revolutionized modern taxonomy. His works implemented a standardized binomial naming system for animal and plant species, [ 51 ] which proved to be an elegant solution to a chaotic and disorganized taxonomic literature. He not only introduced the standard of class, order, genus, and species, but also made it possible to identify plants and animals from his book, by using the smaller parts of the flower (known as the Linnaean system ). [ 51 ] 

Plant and animal taxonomists regard Linnaeus' work as the "starting point" for valid names (at 1753 and 1758 respectively). [ 52 ] Names published before these dates are referred to as "pre-Linnaean", and not considered valid (with the exception of spiders published in Svenska Spindlar [ 53 ] ). Even taxonomic names published by Linnaeus himself before these dates are considered pre-Linnaean. 

# Modern system of classification 

Main articles: Evolutionary taxonomy and Phylogenetic nomenclature 
Evolution of the vertebrates at class level, width of spindles indicating number of families. Spindle diagrams are typical for evolutionary taxonomy . The same relationship, expressed as a cladogram typical for cladistics 

A pattern of groups nested within groups was specified by Linnaeus' classifications of plants and animals, and these patterns began to be represented as dendrograms of the animal and plant kingdoms toward the end of the 18th century, well before Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species was published. [ 36 ] The pattern of the "Natural System" did not entail a generating process, such as evolution, but may have implied it, inspiring early transmutationist thinkers. Among early works exploring the idea of a transmutation of species were Zoonomia in 1796 by Erasmus Darwin (Charles Darwin's grandfather), and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck 's Philosophie zoologique of 1809. [ 19 ] The idea was popularized in the Anglophone world by the speculative but widely read Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation , published anonymously by Robert Chambers in 1844. [ 54 ] 

With Darwin's theory, a general acceptance quickly appeared that a classification should reflect the Darwinian principle of common descent . [ 55 ] Tree of life representations became popular in scientific works, with known fossil groups incorporated. One of the first modern groups tied to fossil ancestors was birds. [ 56 ] Using the then newly discovered fossils of Archaeopteryx and Hesperornis , Thomas Henry Huxley pronounced that they had evolved from dinosaurs, a group formally named by Richard Owen in 1842. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] The resulting description, that of dinosaurs "giving rise to" or being "the ancestors of" birds, is the essential hallmark of evolutionary taxonomic thinking. As more and more fossil groups were found and recognized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, palaeontologists worked to understand the history of animals through the ages by linking together known groups. [ 59 ] With the modern evolutionary synthesis of the early 1940s, an essentially modern understanding of the evolution of the major groups was in place. As evolutionary taxonomy is based on Linnaean taxonomic ranks, the two terms are largely interchangeable in modern use. [ 60 ] 

The cladistic method has emerged since the 1960s. [ 55 ] In 1958, Julian Huxley used the term clade . [ 19 ] Later, in 1960, Cain and Harrison introduced the term cladistic . [ 19 ] The salient feature is arranging taxa in a hierarchical evolutionary tree , with the desired objective of all named taxa being monophyletic. [ 55 ] A taxon is called monophyletic if it includes all the descendants of an ancestral form. [ 61 ] [ 62 ] Groups that have descendant groups removed from them are termed paraphyletic , [ 61 ] while groups representing more than one branch from the tree of life are called polyphyletic . [ 61 ] [ 62 ] Monophyletic groups are recognized and diagnosed on the basis of synapomorphies , shared derived character states. [ 63 ] 

Cladistic classifications are compatible with traditional Linnean taxonomy and the Codes of Zoological and Botanical nomenclature , to a certain extent. [ 64 ] An alternative system of nomenclature, the International Code of Phylogenetic Nomenclature or PhyloCode has been proposed, which regulates the formal naming of clades. [ 65 ] [ 27 ] [ 9 ] Linnaean ranks are optional and have no formal standing under the PhyloCode , which is intended to coexist with the current, rank-based codes. [ 27 ] While popularity of phylogenetic nomenclature has grown steadily in the last few decades, [ 9 ] it remains to be seen whether a majority of systematists will eventually adopt the PhyloCode or continue using the current systems of nomenclature that have been employed (and modified, but arguably not as much as some systematists wish) [ 66 ] [ 67 ] for over 250 years. 

# Kingdoms and domains 

Main articles: Kingdom (biology) and Domain (biology) 
The basic scheme of modern classification. Many other levels can be used; domain, the highest level within life, is both new and disputed. 

Domains are a relatively new grouping. First proposed in 1977, Carl Woese 's three-domain system was not generally accepted until later. [ 68 ] One main characteristic of the three-domain method is the separation of Archaea and Bacteria , previously grouped into the single kingdom Bacteria (a kingdom also sometimes called Monera ), [ 69 ] with the Eukaryota for all organisms whose cells contain a nucleus . [ 70 ] A small number of scientists include a sixth kingdom, Archaea, but do not accept the domain method. [ 69 ] 

Thomas Cavalier-Smith , who published extensively on the classification of protists , in 2002 [ 71 ] proposed that the Neomura , the clade that groups together the Archaea and Eucarya , would have evolved from Bacteria, more precisely from Actinomycetota . His 2004 classification treated the archaeobacteria as part of a subkingdom of the kingdom Bacteria, i.e., he rejected the three-domain system entirely. [ 72 ] Stefan Luketa in 2012 proposed a five "dominion" system, adding Prionobiota ( acellular and without nucleic acid ) and Virusobiota (acellular but with nucleic acid) to the traditional three domains. [ 73 ]

# Recent comprehensive classifications 

Partial classifications exist for many individual groups of organisms and are revised and replaced as new information becomes available; however, comprehensive, published treatments of most or all life are rarer; recent examples are that of Adl et al., 2012 and 2019, [ 81 ] [ 82 ] which covers eukaryotes only with an emphasis on protists, and Ruggiero et al., 2015, [ 83 ] covering both eukaryotes and prokaryotes to the rank of Order, although both exclude fossil representatives. [ 83 ] A separate compilation (Ruggiero, 2014) [ 84 ] covers extant taxa to the rank of Family. Other, database-driven treatments include the Encyclopedia of Life , the Global Biodiversity Information Facility , the NCBI taxonomy database , the Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera , the Open Tree of Life , and the Catalogue of Life . The Paleobiology Database is a resource for fossils. 

# Application 

Biological taxonomy is a sub-discipline of biology , and is generally practiced by biologists known as "taxonomists", although enthusiastic naturalists are also frequently involved in the publication of new taxa. [ 85 ] Because taxonomy aims to describe and organize life , the work conducted by taxonomists is essential for the study of biodiversity and the resulting field of conservation biology . [ 86 ] [ 87 ] 

# Classifying organisms 

Main article: Taxonomic rank 

Biological classification is a critical component of the taxonomic process. As a result, it informs the user as to what the relatives of the taxon are hypothesized to be. Biological classification uses taxonomic ranks, including among others (in order from most inclusive to least inclusive): domain , kingdom , phylum , class , order , family , genus , species , and strain . [ 88 ] [ note 1 ] 

# Taxonomic descriptions 

See also: Species description 
Type specimen for Nepenthes smilesii , a tropical pitcher plant 

The "definition" of a taxon is encapsulated by its description or its diagnosis or by both combined. There are no set rules governing the definition of taxa, but the naming and publication of new taxa is governed by sets of rules. [ 8 ] In zoology , the nomenclature for the more commonly used ranks ( superfamily to subspecies ), is regulated by the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ( ICZN Code ). [ 89 ] In the fields of phycology , mycology , and botany , the naming of taxa is governed by the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants ( ICN ). [ 90 ] 

The initial description of a taxon involves five main requirements: [ 91 ] 

- The taxon must be given a name based on the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet (a binomial for new species, or uninomial for other ranks). 
- The name must be unique (i.e. not a homonym ). 
- The description must be based on at least one name-bearing type specimen . 
- It should include statements about appropriate attributes either to describe (define) the taxon or to differentiate it from other taxa (the diagnosis, ICZN Code , Article 13.1.1, ICN , Article 38, which may or may not be based on morphology [ 92 ] ). Both codes deliberately separate defining the content of a taxon (its circumscription ) from defining its name. 
- These first four requirements must be published in a work that is obtainable in numerous identical copies, as a permanent scientific record. 

However, often much more information is included, like the geographic range of the taxon, ecological notes, chemistry, behavior, etc. How researchers arrive at their taxa varies: depending on the available data, and resources, methods vary from simple quantitative or qualitative comparisons of striking features, to elaborate computer analyses of large amounts of DNA sequence data. [ 93 ] 

# Author citation 

Main articles: Author citation (botany) and Author citation (zoology) 

An "authority" may be placed after a scientific name. [ 94 ] The authority is the name of the scientist or scientists who first validly published the name. [ 94 ] For example, in 1758, Linnaeus gave the Asian elephant the scientific name Elephas maximus , so the name is sometimes written as " Elephas maximus Linnaeus, 1758". [ 95 ] The names of authors are often abbreviated: the abbreviation L. , for Linnaeus, is commonly used. In botany, there is, in fact, a regulated list of standard abbreviations (see list of botanists by author abbreviation ). [ 96 ] The system for assigning authorities differs slightly between botany and zoology . [ 8 ] However, it is standard that if the genus of a species has been changed since the original description, the original authority's name is placed in parentheses. [ 97 ] 

# Phenetics 

Main article: Phenetics 
A comparison of phylogenetic and phenetic (character-based) concepts 

In phenetics, also known as taximetrics, or numerical taxonomy, organisms are classified based on overall similarity, regardless of their phylogeny or evolutionary relationships. [ 19 ] It results in a measure of hypergeometric "distance" between taxa. Phenetic methods have become relatively rare in modern times, largely superseded by cladistic analyses, as phenetic methods do not distinguish shared ancestral (or plesiomorphic ) traits from shared derived (or apomorphic ) traits. [ 98 ] However, certain phenetic methods, such as neighbor joining , have persisted, as rapid estimators of relationships when more advanced methods (such as Bayesian inference ) are too computationally expensive. [ 99 ] 

# Databases 

Main article: Taxonomic database 

Modern taxonomy uses database technologies to search and catalogue classifications and their documentation. [ 100 ] While there is no commonly used database, there are comprehensive databases such as the Catalogue of Life , which attempts to list every documented species. [ 101 ] The catalogue listed 1.64 million species for all kingdoms as of April 2016 [update] , claiming coverage of more than three-quarters of the estimated species known to modern science. [ 102 ]

Animals are multicellular , eukaryotic organisms comprising the biological kingdom Animalia ( / ˌ æ n ɪ ˈ m eɪ l i ə / [ 4 ] ). With few exceptions, animals consume organic material , breathe oxygen , have myocytes and are able to move , can reproduce sexually , and grow from a hollow sphere of cells , the blastula , during embryonic development . Animals form a clade , meaning that they arose from a single common ancestor . Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described , of which around 1.05 million are insects , over 85,000 are molluscs , and around 65,000 are vertebrates . It has been estimated there are as many as 7.77 million animal species on Earth. Animal body lengths range from 8.5 μm (0.00033 in) to 33.6 m (110 ft). They have complex ecologies and interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs . The scientific study of animals is known as zoology , and the study of animal behaviour is known as ethology . 

The animal kingdom is divided into five major clades, namely Porifera , Ctenophora , Placozoa , Cnidaria and Bilateria . Most living animal species belong to the clade Bilateria, a highly proliferative clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric and significantly cephalised body plan , and the vast majority of bilaterians belong to two large clades: the protostomes , which includes organisms such as arthropods , molluscs , flatworms , annelids and nematodes ; and the deuterostomes , which include echinoderms , hemichordates and chordates , the latter of which contains the vertebrates . The much smaller basal phylum Xenacoelomorpha have an uncertain position within Bilateria. 

Animals first appeared in the fossil record in the late Cryogenian period and diversified in the subsequent Ediacaran period in what is known as the Avalon explosion . Nearly all modern animal phyla first appeared in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian explosion , which began around 539 million years ago (Mya), and most classes during the Ordovician radiation 485.4 Mya. Common to all living animals, 6,331 groups of genes have been identified that may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived about 650 Mya during the Cryogenian period. 

Historically, Aristotle divided animals into those with blood and those without . Carl Linnaeus created the first hierarchical biological classification for animals in 1758 with his Systema Naturae , which Jean-Baptiste Lamarck expanded into 14 phyla by 1809. In 1874, Ernst Haeckel divided the animal kingdom into the multicellular Metazoa (now synonymous with Animalia) and the Protozoa , single-celled organisms no longer considered animals. In modern times, the biological classification of animals relies on advanced techniques, such as molecular phylogenetics , which are effective at demonstrating the evolutionary relationships between taxa . 

Humans make use of many other animal species for food (including meat , eggs , and dairy products ), for materials (such as leather , fur , and wool ), as pets and as working animals for transportation , and services . Dogs , the first domesticated animal, have been used in hunting , in security and in warfare , as have horses , pigeons and birds of prey ; while other terrestrial and aquatic animals are hunted for sports, trophies or profits. Non-human animals are also an important cultural element of human evolution , having appeared in cave arts and totems since the earliest times, and are frequently featured in mythology , religion , arts , literature , heraldry , politics , and sports . 

# Etymology 

The word animal comes from the Latin noun animal of the same meaning, which is itself derived from Latin animalis 'having breath or soul'. [ 5 ] The biological definition includes all members of the kingdom Animalia. [ 6 ] In colloquial usage, the term animal is often used to refer only to nonhuman animals. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] The term metazoa is derived from Ancient Greek μετα meta 'after' (in biology, the prefix meta- stands for 'later') and ζῷᾰ zōia 'animals', plural of ζῷον zōion 'animal'. [ 11 ] A metazoan is any member of the group Metazoa . [ 12 ] 

# Characteristics 

Animals are unique in having the ball of cells of the early embryo (1) develop into a hollow ball or blastula (2). 

Animals have several characteristics that they share with other living things. Animals are eukaryotic , multicellular , and aerobic , as are plants and fungi . [ 13 ] Unlike plants and algae , which produce their own food , [ 14 ] animals cannot produce their own food , [ 15 ] [ 16 ] a feature they share with fungi. Animals ingest organic material and digest it internally. [ 17 ] 

# Structural features 

Animals have structural characteristics that set them apart from all other living things: 

- cells surrounded by an extracellular matrix [ 18 ] composed of 
- collagen [ 19 ] and 
- elastic glycoproteins [ 18 ] [ 20 ] 
- motility [ 21 ] i.e. able to spontaneously move their bodies during at least part of their life cycle . 
- a blastula stage during embryonic development [ 22 ] 

Typically, there is an internal digestive chamber with either one opening (in Ctenophora, Cnidaria, and flatworms) or two openings (in most bilaterians). [ 23 ] 

# Development 

Animal development is controlled by Hox genes , which signal the times and places to develop structures such as body segments and limbs. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] 

During development, the animal extracellular matrix forms a relatively flexible framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganised into specialised tissues and organs, making the formation of complex structures possible, and allowing cells to be differentiated . [ 26 ] The extracellular matrix may be calcified, forming structures such as shells , bones , and spicules . [ 27 ] In contrast, the cells of other multicellular organisms (primarily algae, plants, and fungi ) are held in place by cell walls, and so develop by progressive growth. [ 28 ] 

# Reproduction 

See also: Sexual reproduction § Animals , and Asexual reproduction § Examples in animals 
Sexual reproduction is nearly universal in animals, such as these dragonflies . 

Nearly all animals make use of some form of sexual reproduction. [ 29 ] They produce haploid gametes by meiosis ; the smaller, motile gametes are spermatozoa and the larger, non-motile gametes are ova . [ 30 ] These fuse to form zygotes , [ 31 ] which develop via mitosis into a hollow sphere, called a blastula. In sponges, blastula larvae swim to a new location, attach to the seabed, and develop into a new sponge. [ 32 ] In most other groups, the blastula undergoes more complicated rearrangement. [ 33 ] It first invaginates to form a gastrula with a digestive chamber and two separate germ layers , an external ectoderm and an internal endoderm . [ 34 ] In most cases, a third germ layer, the mesoderm , also develops between them. [ 35 ] These germ layers then differentiate to form tissues and organs. [ 36 ] 

Repeated instances of mating with a close relative during sexual reproduction generally leads to inbreeding depression within a population due to the increased prevalence of harmful recessive traits. [ 37 ] [ 38 ] Animals have evolved numerous mechanisms for avoiding close inbreeding . [ 39 ] 

Some animals are capable of asexual reproduction , which often results in a genetic clone of the parent. This may take place through fragmentation ; budding , such as in Hydra and other cnidarians ; or parthenogenesis , where fertile eggs are produced without mating , such as in aphids . [ 40 ] [ 41 ] 

# Ecology 

Predators , such as this ultramarine flycatcher ( Ficedula superciliaris ), feed on other animals. 

Animals are categorised into ecological groups depending on their trophic levels and how they consume organic material . Such groupings include carnivores (further divided into subcategories such as piscivores , insectivores , ovivores , etc.), herbivores (subcategorised into folivores , graminivores , frugivores , granivores , nectarivores , algivores , etc.), omnivores , fungivores , scavengers / detritivores , [ 42 ] and parasites . [ 43 ] Interactions between animals of each biome form complex food webs within that ecosystem . In carnivorous or omnivorous species, predation is a consumer–resource interaction where the predator feeds on another organism, its prey , [ 44 ] who often evolves anti-predator adaptations to avoid being fed upon. Selective pressures imposed on one another lead to an evolutionary arms race between predator and prey, resulting in various antagonistic/ competitive coevolutions . [ 45 ] [ 46 ] Almost all multicellular predators are animals. [ 47 ] Some consumers use multiple methods; for example, in parasitoid wasps , the larvae feed on the hosts' living tissues, killing them in the process, [ 48 ] but the adults primarily consume nectar from flowers. [ 49 ] Other animals may have very specific feeding behaviours , such as hawksbill sea turtles which mainly eat sponges . [ 50 ] 
Hydrothermal vent mussels and shrimps 

Most animals rely on biomass and bioenergy produced by plants and phytoplanktons (collectively called producers ) through photosynthesis . Herbivores, as primary consumers , eat the plant material directly to digest and absorb the nutrients, while carnivores and other animals on higher trophic levels indirectly acquire the nutrients by eating the herbivores or other animals that have eaten the herbivores. Animals oxidise carbohydrates , lipids , proteins and other biomolecules in cellular respiration , which allows the animal to grow and to sustain basal metabolism and fuel other biological processes such as locomotion . [ 51 ] [ 52 ] Some benthic animals living close to hydrothermal vents and cold seeps on the dark sea floor consume organic matter produced through chemosynthesis (via oxidising inorganic compounds such as hydrogen sulfide ) by archaea and bacteria . [ 53 ] 

Animals originated in the ocean; all extant animal phyla, except for Micrognathozoa and Onychophora , feature at least some marine species. However, several lineages of arthropods begun to colonise land around the same time as land plants , probably between 510 and 471 million years ago, during the Late Cambrian or Early Ordovician . [ 54 ] Vertebrates such as the lobe-finned fish Tiktaalik started to move on to land in the late Devonian , about 375 million years ago. [ 55 ] [ 56 ] Other notable animal groups that colonized land environments are Mollusca , Platyhelmintha , Annelida , Tardigrada , Onychophora , Rotifera , Nematoda . 

Animals occupy virtually all of earth's habitats and microhabitats, with faunas adapted to salt water, hydrothermal vents, fresh water, hot springs, swamps, forests, pastures, deserts, air, and the interiors of other organisms. [ 57 ] Animals are however not particularly heat tolerant ; very few of them can survive at constant temperatures above 50 °C (122 °F) [ 58 ] or in the most extreme cold deserts of continental Antarctica . [ 59 ] 

The collective global geomorphic influence of animals on the processes shaping the Earth's surface remains largely understudied, with most studies limited to individual species and well-known exemplars. [ 60 ]

The blue whale ( Balaenoptera musculus ) is the largest animal that has ever lived, weighing up to 190 tonnes and measuring up to 33.6 metres (110 ft) long. [ 61 ] [ 62 ] The largest extant terrestrial animal is the African bush elephant ( Loxodonta africana ), weighing up to 12.25 tonnes [ 61 ] and measuring up to 10.67 metres (35.0 ft) long. [ 61 ] The largest terrestrial animals that ever lived were titanosaur sauropod dinosaurs such as Argentinosaurus , which may have weighed as much as 73 tonnes, and Supersaurus which may have reached 39 metres. [ 63 ] [ 64 ] Several animals are microscopic; some Myxozoa ( obligate parasites within the Cnidaria) never grow larger than 20 μm , [ 65 ] and one of the smallest species ( Myxobolus shekel ) is no more than 8.5 μm when fully grown. [ 66 ]

# Numbers and habitats of major phyla 

The following table lists estimated numbers of described extant species for the major animal phyla, [ 67 ] along with their principal habitats (terrestrial, fresh water, [ 68 ] and marine), [ 69 ] and free-living or parasitic ways of life. [ 70 ] Species estimates shown here are based on numbers described scientifically; much larger estimates have been calculated based on various means of prediction, and these can vary wildly. For instance, around 25,000–27,000 species of nematodes have been described, while published estimates of the total number of nematode species include 10,000–20,000; 500,000; 10 million; and 100 million. [ 71 ] Using patterns within the taxonomic hierarchy, the total number of animal species—including those not yet described—was calculated to be about 7.77 million in 2011. [ 72 ] [ 73 ] [ a ]

# Evolutionary origin 

Further information: Urmetazoan 

Evidence of animals is found as long ago as the Cryogenian period. 24-Isopropylcholestane (24-ipc) has been found in rocks from roughly 650 million years ago; it is only produced by sponges and pelagophyte algae. Its likely origin is from sponges based on molecular clock estimates for the origin of 24-ipc production in both groups. Analyses of pelagophyte algae consistently recover a Phanerozoic origin, while analyses of sponges recover a Neoproterozoic origin, consistent with the appearance of 24-ipc in the fossil record. [ 89 ] [ 90 ] 

The first body fossils of animals appear in the Ediacaran , represented by forms such as Charnia and Spriggina . It had long been doubted whether these fossils truly represented animals, [ 91 ] [ 92 ] [ 93 ] but the discovery of the animal lipid cholesterol in fossils of Dickinsonia establishes their nature. [ 94 ] Animals are thought to have originated under low-oxygen conditions, suggesting that they were capable of living entirely by anaerobic respiration , but as they became specialised for aerobic metabolism they became fully dependent on oxygen in their environments. [ 95 ] 

Many animal phyla first appear in the fossil record during the Cambrian explosion , starting about 539 million years ago, in beds such as the Burgess Shale . [ 96 ] Extant phyla in these rocks include molluscs , brachiopods , onychophorans , tardigrades , arthropods , echinoderms and hemichordates , along with numerous now-extinct forms such as the predatory Anomalocaris . The apparent suddenness of the event may however be an artefact of the fossil record, rather than showing that all these animals appeared simultaneously. [ 97 ] [ 98 ] [ 99 ] [ 100 ] [ 101 ] That view is supported by the discovery of Auroralumina attenboroughii , the earliest known Ediacaran crown-group cnidarian (557–562 mya, some 20 million years before the Cambrian explosion) from Charnwood Forest , England. It is thought to be one of the earliest predators , catching small prey with its nematocysts as modern cnidarians do. [ 102 ] 

Some palaeontologists have suggested that animals appeared much earlier than the Cambrian explosion, possibly as early as 1 billion years ago. [ 103 ] Early fossils that might represent animals appear for example in the 665-million-year-old rocks of the Trezona Formation of South Australia . These fossils are interpreted as most probably being early sponges . [ 104 ] Trace fossils such as tracks and burrows found in the Tonian period (from 1 gya) may indicate the presence of triploblastic worm-like animals, roughly as large (about 5 mm wide) and complex as earthworms. [ 105 ] However, similar tracks are produced by the giant single-celled protist Gromia sphaerica , so the Tonian trace fossils may not indicate early animal evolution. [ 106 ] [ 107 ] Around the same time, the layered mats of microorganisms called stromatolites decreased in diversity, perhaps due to grazing by newly evolved animals. [ 108 ] Objects such as sediment-filled tubes that resemble trace fossils of the burrows of wormlike animals have been found in 1.2 gya rocks in North America, in 1.5 gya rocks in Australia and North America, and in 1.7 gya rocks in Australia. Their interpretation as having an animal origin is disputed, as they might be water-escape or other structures. [ 109 ] [ 110 ]

# Phylogeny 

Further information: Lists of animals 

# External phylogeny 

Animals are monophyletic , meaning they are derived from a common ancestor. Animals are the sister group to the choanoflagellates , with which they form the Choanozoa . [ 111 ] Ros-Rocher and colleagues (2021) trace the origins of animals to unicellular ancestors, providing the external phylogeny shown in the cladogram. Uncertainty of relationships is indicated with dashed lines. The animal clade had certainly originated by 650 mya, and may have come into being as much as 800 mya, based on molecular clock evidence for different phyla. [ 112 ]

# Internal phylogeny 

The relationships at the base of the animal tree have been debated. [ 113 ] [ 114 ] Other than Ctenophora, the Bilateria and Cnidaria are the only groups with symmetry, and other evidence shows they are closely related. [ 115 ] In addition to sponges, Placozoa has no symmetry and was often considered a "missing link" between protists and multicellular animals. The presence of hox genes in Placozoa shows that they were once more complex. [ 116 ] 

The Porifera (sponges) have long been assumed to be sister to the rest of the animals, but there is evidence that the Ctenophora may be in that position. Molecular phylogenetics has supported both the sponge-sister and ctenophore-sister hypotheses. In 2017, Roberto Feuda and colleagues, using amino acid differences, presented both, with the following cladogram for the sponge-sister view that they supported (their ctenophore-sister tree simply interchanging the places of ctenophores and sponges): [ 117 ]

# Non-bilaterians 

Non-bilaterians include sponges (centre) and corals (background). 

Sponges are physically very distinct from other animals, and were long thought to have diverged first, representing the oldest animal phylum and forming a sister clade to all other animals. [ 119 ] Despite their morphological dissimilarity with all other animals, genetic evidence suggests sponges may be more closely related to other animals than the comb jellies are. [ 120 ] [ 121 ] Sponges lack the complex organisation found in most other animal phyla; [ 122 ] their cells are differentiated, but in most cases not organised into distinct tissues, unlike all other animals. [ 123 ] They typically feed by drawing in water through pores, filtering out small particles of food. [ 124 ] 

The Ctenophora and Cnidaria are radially symmetric and have digestive chambers with a single opening, which serves as both mouth and anus. [ 125 ] Animals in both phyla have distinct tissues, but these are not organised into discrete organs . [ 126 ] They are diploblastic , having only two main germ layers, ectoderm and endoderm. [ 127 ] 

The tiny placozoans have no permanent digestive chamber and no symmetry; they superficially resemble amoebae. [ 128 ] [ 129 ] Their phylogeny is poorly defined, and under active research. [ 120 ] [ 130 ] 

# Bilateria 

Main articles: Bilateria and Symmetry (biology) § Bilateral symmetry 

The remaining animals, the great majority—comprising some 29 phyla and over a million species—form the Bilateria clade , which have a bilaterally symmetric body plan . The Bilateria are triploblastic , with three well-developed germ layers, and their tissues form distinct organs . The digestive chamber has two openings, a mouth and an anus, and in the Nephrozoa there is an internal body cavity, a coelom or pseudocoelom. These animals have a head end (anterior) and a tail end (posterior), a back (dorsal) surface and a belly (ventral) surface, and a left and a right side. [ 131 ] [ 132 ] A modern consensus phylogenetic tree for the Bilateria is shown below. [ 133 ]

Idealised nephrozoan body plan. [ c ] With an elongated body and a direction of movement the animal has head and tail ends. Sense organs and mouth form the basis of the head . Opposed circular and longitudinal muscles enable peristaltic motion . 

Having a front end means that this part of the body encounters stimuli, such as food, favouring cephalisation , the development of a head with sense organs and a mouth. Many bilaterians have a combination of circular muscles that constrict the body, making it longer, and an opposing set of longitudinal muscles, that shorten the body; [ 132 ] these enable soft-bodied animals with a hydrostatic skeleton to move by peristalsis . [ 134 ] They also have a gut that extends through the basically cylindrical body from mouth to anus. Many bilaterian phyla have primary larvae which swim with cilia and have an apical organ containing sensory cells. However, over evolutionary time, descendant spaces have evolved which have lost one or more of each of these characteristics. For example, adult echinoderms are radially symmetric (unlike their larvae), while some parasitic worms have extremely simplified body structures. [ 131 ] [ 132 ] 

Genetic studies have considerably changed zoologists' understanding of the relationships within the Bilateria. Most appear to belong to two major lineages, the protostomes and the deuterostomes . [ 135 ] It is often suggested that the basalmost bilaterians are the Xenacoelomorpha , with all other bilaterians belonging to the subclade Nephrozoa . [ 136 ] [ 137 ] [ 138 ] However, this suggestion has been contested, with other studies finding that xenacoelomorphs are more closely related to Ambulacraria than to other bilaterians. [ 139 ] 

# Protostomes and deuterostomes 

Further information: Embryological origins of the mouth and anus 

Main articles: Protostome and Deuterostome 
The bilaterian gut develops in two ways. In many protostomes , the blastopore develops into the mouth, while in deuterostomes it becomes the anus. 

Protostomes and deuterostomes differ in several ways. Early in development, deuterostome embryos undergo radial cleavage during cell division, while many protostomes (the Spiralia ) undergo spiral cleavage. [ 140 ] Animals from both groups possess a complete digestive tract, but in protostomes the first opening of the embryonic gut develops into the mouth, and the anus forms secondarily. In deuterostomes, the anus forms first while the mouth develops secondarily. [ 141 ] [ 142 ] Most protostomes have schizocoelous development , where cells simply fill in the interior of the gastrula to form the mesoderm. In deuterostomes, the mesoderm forms by enterocoelic pouching , through invagination of the endoderm. [ 143 ] 

The main deuterostome taxa are the Ambulacraria and the Chordata. [ 144 ] Ambulacraria are exclusively marine and include acorn worms , starfish , sea urchins , and sea cucumbers . [ 145 ] The chordates are dominated by the vertebrates (animals with backbones ), [ 146 ] which consist of fishes , amphibians , reptiles , birds , and mammals . [ 147 ] [ 148 ] [ 149 ] 
The Spiralia develop with spiral cleavage in the embryo, as here in a sea snail. 

The protostomes include the Ecdysozoa , named after their shared trait of ecdysis , growth by moulting, [ 150 ] Among the largest ecdysozoan phyla are the arthropods and the nematodes . [ 151 ] The rest of the protostomes are in the Spiralia , named for their pattern of developing by spiral cleavage in the early embryo. Major spiralian phyla include the annelids and molluscs . [ 152 ] 

# History of classification 

Further information: Taxonomy (biology) , History of zoology through 1859 , and History of zoology since 1859 
Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck led the creation of a modern classification of invertebrates , breaking up Linnaeus's "Vermes" into 9 phyla by 1809. [ 153 ] 

In the classical era , Aristotle divided animals , [ d ] based on his own observations, into those with blood (roughly, the vertebrates) and those without. The animals were then arranged on a scale from man (with blood, two legs, rational soul) down through the live-bearing tetrapods (with blood, four legs, sensitive soul) and other groups such as crustaceans (no blood, many legs, sensitive soul) down to spontaneously generating creatures like sponges (no blood, no legs, vegetable soul). Aristotle was uncertain whether sponges were animals, which in his system ought to have sensation, appetite, and locomotion, or plants, which did not: he knew that sponges could sense touch and would contract if about to be pulled off their rocks, but that they were rooted like plants and never moved about. [ 154 ] 

In 1758, Carl Linnaeus created the first hierarchical classification in his Systema Naturae . [ 155 ] In his original scheme, the animals were one of three kingdoms, divided into the classes of Vermes , Insecta , Pisces , Amphibia , Aves , and Mammalia . Since then, the last four have all been subsumed into a single phylum, the Chordata , while his Insecta (which included the crustaceans and arachnids) and Vermes have been renamed or broken up. The process was begun in 1793 by Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck , who called the Vermes une espèce de chaos ('a chaotic mess') [ e ] and split the group into three new phyla: worms, echinoderms, and polyps (which contained corals and jellyfish). By 1809, in his Philosophie Zoologique , Lamarck had created nine phyla apart from vertebrates (where he still had four phyla: mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish) and molluscs, namely cirripedes , annelids, crustaceans, arachnids, insects, worms, radiates , polyps, and infusorians . [ 153 ] 

In his 1817 Le Règne Animal , Georges Cuvier used comparative anatomy to group the animals into four embranchements ('branches' with different body plans, roughly corresponding to phyla), namely vertebrates, molluscs, articulated animals (arthropods and annelids), and zoophytes (radiata) (echinoderms, cnidaria and other forms). [ 157 ] This division into four was followed by the embryologist Karl Ernst von Baer in 1828, the zoologist Louis Agassiz in 1857, and the comparative anatomist Richard Owen in 1860. [ 158 ] 

In 1874, Ernst Haeckel divided the animal kingdom into two subkingdoms: Metazoa (multicellular animals, with five phyla: coelenterates, echinoderms, articulates, molluscs, and vertebrates) and Protozoa (single-celled animals), including a sixth animal phylum, sponges. [ 159 ] [ 158 ] The protozoa were later moved to the former kingdom Protista , leaving only the Metazoa as a synonym of Animalia. [ 160 ]

Main article: Human uses of animals 
Sides of beef in a slaughterhouse 

The human population exploits a large number of other animal species for food, both of domesticated livestock species in animal husbandry and, mainly at sea, by hunting wild species. [ 161 ] [ 162 ] Marine fish of many species are caught commercially for food. A smaller number of species are farmed commercially . [ 161 ] [ 163 ] [ 164 ] Humans and their livestock make up more than 90% of the biomass of all terrestrial vertebrates, and almost as much as all insects combined. [ 165 ] 

Invertebrates including cephalopods , crustaceans , insects —principally bees and silkworms —and bivalve or gastropod molluscs are hunted or farmed for food, fibres. [ 166 ] [ 167 ] Chickens , cattle , sheep , pigs , and other animals are raised as livestock for meat across the world. [ 162 ] [ 168 ] [ 169 ] Animal fibres such as wool and silk are used to make textiles, while animal sinews have been used as lashings and bindings, and leather is widely used to make shoes and other items. Animals have been hunted and farmed for their fur to make items such as coats and hats. [ 170 ] Dyestuffs including carmine ( cochineal ), [ 171 ] [ 172 ] shellac , [ 173 ] [ 174 ] and kermes [ 175 ] [ 176 ] have been made from the bodies of insects. Working animals including cattle and horses have been used for work and transport from the first days of agriculture. [ 177 ] 

Animals such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster serve a major role in science as experimental models . [ 178 ] [ 179 ] [ 180 ] [ 181 ] Animals have been used to create vaccines since their discovery in the 18th century. [ 182 ] Some medicines such as the cancer drug trabectedin are based on toxins or other molecules of animal origin. [ 183 ] 
A gun dog retrieving a duck during a hunt 

People have used hunting dogs to help chase down and retrieve animals, [ 184 ] and birds of prey to catch birds and mammals, [ 185 ] while tethered cormorants have been used to catch fish . [ 186 ] Poison dart frogs have been used to poison the tips of blowpipe darts . [ 187 ] [ 188 ] A wide variety of animals are kept as pets, from invertebrates such as tarantulas, octopuses, and praying mantises , [ 189 ] reptiles such as snakes and chameleons , [ 190 ] and birds including canaries , parakeets , and parrots [ 191 ] all finding a place. However, the most kept pet species are mammals, namely dogs , cats , and rabbits . [ 192 ] [ 193 ] [ 194 ] There is a tension between the role of animals as companions to humans, and their existence as individuals with rights of their own. [ 195 ] 

A wide variety of terrestrial and aquatic animals are hunted for sport . [ 196 ] 

# Symbolic uses 

The signs of the Western and Chinese zodiacs are based on animals. [ 197 ] [ 198 ] In China and Japan, the butterfly has been seen as the personification of a person's soul , [ 199 ] and in classical representation the butterfly is also the symbol of the soul. [ 200 ] [ 201 ] 
Artistic vision: Still Life with Lobster and Oysters by Alexander Coosemans , c. 1660 

Animals have been the subjects of art from the earliest times, both historical, as in ancient Egypt, and prehistoric, as in the cave paintings at Lascaux . Major animal paintings include Albrecht Dürer 's 1515 The Rhinoceros , and George Stubbs 's c. 1762 horse portrait Whistlejacket . [ 202 ] Insects , birds and mammals play roles in literature and film, [ 203 ] such as in giant bug movies . [ 204 ] [ 205 ] [ 206 ] 

Animals including insects [ 199 ] and mammals [ 207 ] feature in mythology and religion. The scarab beetle was sacred in ancient Egypt , [ 208 ] and the cow is sacred in Hinduism . [ 209 ] Among other mammals, deer , [ 207 ] horses , [ 210 ] lions , [ 211 ] bats , [ 212 ] bears , [ 213 ] and wolves [ 214 ] are the subjects of myths and worship.

A chordate ( / ˈ k ɔːr d eɪ t / KOR -dayt ) is a bilaterian animal belonging to the phylum Chordata ( / k ɔːr ˈ d eɪ t ə / kor- DAY -tə ). All chordates possess, at some point during their larval or adult stages, five distinctive physical characteristics ( synapomorphies ) that distinguish them from other taxa . These five synapomorphies are a notochord , a hollow dorsal nerve cord , an endostyle or thyroid , pharyngeal slits , and a post- anal tail . [ 8 ] 

In addition to the morphological characteristics used to define chordates, analysis of genome sequences has identified two conserved signature indels (CSIs) in their proteins: cyclophilin -like protein and inner mitochondrial membrane protease ATP23, which are exclusively shared by all vertebrates , tunicates and cephalochordates . [ 9 ] These CSIs provide molecular means to reliably distinguish chordates from all other animals . 

Chordates are divided into three subphyla : Vertebrata ( fish , amphibians , reptiles , birds and mammals ), whose notochords are replaced by a cartilaginous / bony axial endoskeleton ( spine ) and are cladistically and phylogenetically a subgroup of the clade Craniata (i.e. chordates with a skull ); Tunicata or Urochordata ( sea squirts , salps , and larvaceans ), which only retain the synapomorphies during their larval stage; and Cephalochordata ( lancelets ), which resemble jawless fish but have no gills or a distinct head . The vertebrates and tunicates compose the clade Olfactores , which is sister to Cephalochordata (see diagram under Phylogeny ). Extinct taxa such as the conodonts are chordates, but their internal placement is less certain. Hemichordata (which includes the acorn worms ) was previously considered a fourth chordate subphylum, but now is treated as a separate phylum which are now thought to be closer to the echinoderms , and together they form the clade Ambulacraria , the sister phylum of the chordates. Chordata, Ambulacraria, and possibly Xenacoelomorpha are believed to form the superphylum Deuterostomia , although this called into doubt in a 2021 publication. [ 10 ] 

Chordata is the third-largest phylum of the animal kingdom (behind only the protostomal phyla Arthropoda and Mollusca ) and is also one of the most ancient animal taxa. Chordate fossils have been found from as early as the Cambrian explosion over 539 million years ago. [ 11 ] Of the more than 81,000 living species of chordates, about half are ray-finned fishes ( class Actinopterygii ) and the vast majority of the rest are tetrapods , a terrestrial clade of lobe-finned fishes ( Sarcopterygii ) who evolved air-breathing using lungs . [ 12 ] 

# Etymology 
[ edit ] 

The name "chordate" comes from the first of these synapomorphies, the notochord, which plays a significant role in chordate body plan structuring and movements. Chordates are also bilaterally symmetric , have a coelom , possess a closed circulatory system , and exhibit metameric segmentation . Although the name Chordata is attributed to William Bateson (1885), it was already in prevalent use by 1880. Ernst Haeckel described a taxon comprising tunicates, cephalochordates, and vertebrates in 1866. Though he used the German vernacular form, it is allowed under the ICZN code because of its subsequent latinization. [ 4 ] 

# Anatomy 
[ edit ] 
The glass catfish ( Kryptopterus vitreolus ) is one of the few chordates with a visible backbone . The spinal cord is housed within its backbone. 

Chordates form a phylum of animals that are defined by having at some stage in their lives all of the following anatomical features: [ 13 ] 

- A notochord , a stiff but elastic rod of glycoprotein wrapped in two collagen helices, which extends along the central axis of the body. Among members of the subphylum Vertebrata (vertebrates), the notochord gets replaced by hyaline cartilage or osseous tissue of the spine , and notochord remnants develop into the intervertebral discs , which allow adjacent spinal vertebrae to bend and twist relative to each other. In wholly aquatic species, this helps the animal swim efficiently by flexing its tail side-to-side . 
- A hollow dorsal nerve cord , also known as the neural tube , which develops into the spinal cord , the main communications trunk of the nervous system . In vertebrates, the rostral end of the neural tube enlarges into several vesicles during embryonic development , which give rise to the brain . 
- Pharyngeal slits . The pharynx is the part of the throat immediately behind the mouth . In fish , the slits are modified to form gills , but in some other chordates they are part of a filter-feeding system that extracts food particles from ingested water. In tetrapods , they are only present during embryonic stages of the development. 
- A post- anal tail . A muscular tail that extends backwards beyond the location of the anus. In some chordates such as hominids , this is only present in the embryonic stage. 
- An endostyle . This is a groove in the ventral wall of the pharynx. In filter-feeding species it produces mucus to gather food particles, which helps in transporting food to the esophagus . [ 14 ] It also stores iodine , and may be a precursor of the vertebrate thyroid gland . [ 13 ] 

There are soft constraints that separate chordates from other biological lineages, but are not part of the formal definition: 

- All chordates are deuterostomes , which means that, during embryonic development , the anus forms before the mouth does. 
- All chordates are based on a bilateral body plan . [ 15 ] 
- All chordates are coelomates , and have a fluid-filled body cavity ( coelom ) with a complete serosal lining derived from mesoderm called mesothelium (see Brusca and Brusca ). [ 16 ]

# Cephalochordata: Lancelets 
[ edit ] 

Main article: Lancelet 

Cephalochordates , one of the three subdivisions of chordates, are small, "vaguely fish-shaped" animals that lack brains, clearly defined heads and specialized sense organs. [ 26 ] These burrowing filter-feeders compose the earliest-branching chordate subphylum. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] 

# Tunicata (Urochordata) 
[ edit ] 

Main article: Tunicate (Urochordata) 
Tunicates: sea squirts 

The tunicates have three distinct adult shapes. Each is a member of one of three monophyletic clades. All tunicate larvae have the standard chordate features, including long, tadpole -like tails. Their larva also have rudimentary brains, light sensors and tilt sensors. [ 29 ] 

The smallest of the three groups of tunicates is the Appendicularia . They retain tadpole-like shapes and active swimming all their lives, and were for a long time regarded as larvae of the other two groups. [ 30 ] 

The other two groups, the sea squirts and the salps, metamorphize into adult forms which lose the notochord, nerve cord, and post anal tail. Both are soft-bodied filter feeders with multiple gill slits. They feed on plankton which they collect in their mucus. 

Sea squirts are sessile and consist mainly of water pumps and filter-feeding apparatus. [ 29 ] Most attach firmly to the sea floor, where they remain in one place for life, feeding on plankton. 

The salps float in mid-water, feeding on plankton , and have a two-generation cycle in which one generation is solitary and the next forms chain-like colonies . [ 31 ] 

The etymology of the term Urochordata (Balfour 1881) is from the ancient Greek οὐρά (oura, "tail") + Latin chorda ("cord"), because the notochord is only found in the tail. [ 32 ] The term Tunicata (Lamarck 1816) is recognised as having precedence and is now more commonly used. [ 29 ]

# Craniata (Vertebrata) 
[ edit ] 

Main articles: Craniata and Vertebrata 
Craniate: hagfish 

Craniates all have distinct skulls . They include the hagfish , which have no vertebrae . Michael J. Benton commented that "craniates are characterized by their heads, just as chordates, or possibly all deuterostomes , are by their tails". [ 33 ] 

Most craniates are vertebrates , in which the notochord is replaced by the vertebral column . [ 34 ] It consists of a series of bony or cartilaginous cylindrical vertebrae, generally with neural arches that protect the spinal cord , and with projections that link the vertebrae. Hagfishes have incomplete braincases and no vertebrae, and are therefore not regarded as vertebrates, [ 35 ] but they are members of the craniates, the group within which vertebrates are thought to have evolved . [ 36 ] However the cladistic exclusion of hagfish from the vertebrates is controversial, as they may instead be degenerate vertebrates who have secondarily lost their vertebral columns. [ 37 ] 

Before molecular phylogenetics , the position of lampreys was ambiguous. They have complete braincases and rudimentary vertebrae, and therefore may be regarded as vertebrates and true fish . [ 38 ] However, molecular phylogenetics, which uses DNA to classify organisms, has produced both results that group them with vertebrates and others that group them with hagfish. [ 39 ] If lampreys are more closely related to the hagfish than the other vertebrates, this would suggest that they form a clade , which has been named the Cyclostomata . [ 40 ] 

# Phylogeny 
[ edit ] 

# Overview 
[ edit ] 
Haikouichthys , from about 518 million years ago in China, may be the earliest known fish. [ 41 ] 

There is still much ongoing differential (DNA sequence based) comparison research that is trying to separate out the simplest forms of chordates. As some lineages of the 90% of species that lack a backbone or notochord might have lost these structures over time, this complicates the classification of chordates. Some chordate lineages may only be found by DNA analysis, when there is no physical trace of any chordate-like structures. [ 42 ] 

Attempts to work out the evolutionary relationships of the chordates have produced several hypotheses. The current consensus is that chordates are monophyletic (meaning that the Chordata includes all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor, which is itself a chordate) and that the vertebrates ' nearest relatives are tunicates. In 2016, identification of two conserved signature indels (CSIs) in the proteins cyclophilin-like protein and mitochondrial inner membrane protease ATP23, which are exclusively shared by all vertebrates, tunicates and cephalochordates also provided strong evidence of the monophyly of Chordata. [ 9 ] 

All of the earliest chordate fossils have been found in the Early Cambrian Chengjiang fauna , and include three species that are regarded as fish , [ citation needed ] and hence vertebrates. Because the fossil record of early chordates is poor, only molecular phylogenetics offers a reasonable prospect of dating their emergence. However, the use of molecular phylogenetics for dating evolutionary transitions is controversial. It has proven difficult to produce a detailed classification within the living chordates. Attempts to produce evolutionary " family trees " shows that many of the traditional classes are paraphyletic . [ citation needed ]

Diagram of the evolutionary relationships of chordates [ 14 ] 

While this has been well known since the 19th century, an insistence on only monophyletic taxa has resulted in vertebrate classification being in a state of flux. [ 43 ] 

The majority of animals more complex than jellyfish and other cnidarians are split into two groups, the protostomes and deuterostomes , the latter of which contains chordates. [ 44 ] It seems very likely the 555 million-year-old Kimberella was a member of the protostomes. [ 45 ] [ 46 ] If so, this means the protostome and deuterostome lineages must have split some time before Kimberella appeared—at least 558 million years ago , and hence well before the start of the Cambrian 538.8 million years ago . [ 44 ] Three enigmatic species that are possible very early tunicates, and therefore deuterostomes, were also found from the Ediacaran period – Ausia fenestrata from the Nama Group of Namibia , the sac-like Yarnemia ascidiformis , and one from a second new Ausia -like genus from the Onega Peninsula of northern Russia , Burykhia hunti . Results of a new study have shown possible affinity of these Ediacaran organisms to the ascidians. [ 47 ] [ 48 ] Ausia and Burykhia lived in shallow coastal waters slightly more than 555 to 548 million years ago, and are believed to be the oldest evidence of the chordate lineage of metazoans. [ 48 ] The Russian Precambrian fossil Yarnemia is identified as a tunicate only tentatively, because its fossils are nowhere near as well-preserved as those of Ausia and Burykhia , so this identification has been questioned.

A skeleton of the blue whale , the largest animal, extant or extinct, ever discovered. Mounted outside the Long Marine Laboratory at the University of California, Santa Cruz . The largest blue whale ever reliably recorded measured 98ft (30m) long. A peregrine falcon , the world's fastest animal. Peregrines use gravity and aerodynamics to achieve their top speed of around 242mph (390km/h), as opposed to locomotion. 

Fossils of one major deuterostome group, the echinoderms (whose modern members include starfish , sea urchins and crinoids ), are quite common from the start of the Cambrian, 542 million years ago. [ 49 ] The Mid Cambrian fossil Rhabdotubus johanssoni has been interpreted as a pterobranch hemichordate. [ 50 ] Opinions differ about whether the Chengjiang fauna fossil Yunnanozoon , from the earlier Cambrian, was a hemichordate or chordate. [ 51 ] [ 52 ] Another fossil, Haikouella lanceolata , also from the Chengjiang fauna, is interpreted as a chordate and possibly a craniate, as it shows signs of a heart, arteries, gill filaments, a tail, a neural chord with a brain at the front end, and possibly eyes—although it also had short tentacles round its mouth. [ 52 ] Haikouichthys and Myllokunmingia , also from the Chengjiang fauna, are regarded as fish . [ 41 ] [ 53 ] Pikaia , discovered much earlier (1911) but from the Mid Cambrian Burgess Shale (505 Ma), is also regarded as a primitive chordate. [ 54 ] On the other hand, fossils of early chordates are very rare, since invertebrate chordates have no bones or teeth, and only one has been reported for the rest of the Cambrian. [ 55 ] The best known and earliest unequivocally identified Tunicate is Shankouclava shankouense from the Lower Cambrian Maotianshan Shale at Shankou village, Anning, near Kunming ( South China ). [ 56 ] 

The evolutionary relationships between the chordate groups and between chordates as a whole and their closest deuterostome relatives have been debated since 1890. Studies based on anatomical, embryological , and paleontological data have produced different "family trees". Some closely linked chordates and hemichordates, but that idea is now rejected. [ 14 ] Combining such analyses with data from a small set of ribosome RNA genes eliminated some older ideas, but opened up the possibility that tunicates (urochordates) are "basal deuterostomes", surviving members of the group from which echinoderms, hemichordates and chordates evolved. [ 57 ] Some researchers believe that, within the chordates, craniates are most closely related to cephalochordates, but there are also reasons for regarding tunicates (urochordates) as craniates' closest relatives. [ 14 ] [ 58 ] 

Since early chordates have left a poor fossil record, attempts have been made to calculate the key dates in their evolution by molecular phylogenetics techniques—by analyzing biochemical differences, mainly in RNA. One such study suggested that deuterostomes arose before 900 million years ago and the earliest chordates around 896 million years ago . [ 58 ] However, molecular estimates of dates often disagree with each other and with the fossil record, [ 58 ] and their assumption that the molecular clock runs at a known constant rate has been challenged. [ 59 ] [ 60 ] 

Traditionally, Cephalochordata and Craniata were grouped into the proposed clade "Euchordata", which would have been the sister group to Tunicata/Urochordata. More recently, Cephalochordata has been thought of as a sister group to the "Olfactores", which includes the craniates and tunicates. The matter is not yet settled. [ citation needed ] 

A specific relationship between vertebrates and tunicates is also strongly supported by two CSIs found in the proteins predicted exosome complex RRP44 and serine palmitoyltransferase, that are exclusively shared by species from these two subphyla but not cephalochordates , indicating vertebrates are more closely related to tunicates than cephalochordates.

# Closest non-chordate relatives 
[ edit ] 
Acorn worms or Enteropneusts are example of hemichordates. 

The closest relatives of the chordates are believed to be the hemichordates and Echinodermata , which together form the Ambulacraria .
The Chordata and Ambulacraria together form the superphylum Deuterostomia . 

# Hemichordates 
[ edit ] 

Main article: Hemichordate 

Hemichordates ("half chordates") have some features similar to those of chordates: branchial openings that open into the pharynx and look rather like gill slits; stomochords, similar in composition to notochords , but running in a circle round the "collar", which is ahead of the mouth; and a dorsal nerve cord—but also a smaller ventral nerve cord. 

There are two living groups of hemichordates. The solitary enteropneusts , commonly known as "acorn worms", have long proboscises and worm-like bodies with up to 200 branchial slits, are up to 2.5 metres (8.2 ft) long, and burrow though seafloor sediments . Pterobranchs are colonial animals, often less than 1 millimetre (0.039 in) long individually, whose dwellings are interconnected. Each filter feeds by means of a pair of branched tentacles, and has a short, shield-shaped proboscis. The extinct graptolites , colonial animals whose fossils look like tiny hacksaw blades, lived in tubes similar to those of pterobranchs. [ 66 ] 

# Echinoderms 
[ edit ] 
A red knob sea star, Protoreaster linckii is an example of an asterozoan echinoderm . 

Main article: Echinoderm 

Echinoderms differ from chordates and their other relatives in three conspicuous ways: they possess bilateral symmetry only as larvae – in adulthood they have radial symmetry , meaning that their body pattern is shaped like a wheel; they have tube feet ; and their bodies are supported by dermal skeletons made of calcite , a material not used by chordates. Their hard, calcified shells keep their bodies well protected from the environment, and these skeletons enclose their bodies, but are also covered by thin skins. The feet are powered by another unique feature of echinoderms, a water vascular system of canals that also functions as a "lung" and surrounded by muscles that act as pumps. Crinoids are typically sessile and look rather like flowers (hence the common name " sea lilies "), and use their feather-like arms to filter food particles out of the water; most live anchored to rocks, but a few species can move very slowly. Other echinoderms are mobile and take a variety of body shapes, for example starfish and brittle stars , sea urchins and sea cucumbers . [ 67 ]

- ^ The classification below follows Benton 2004, and uses a synthesis of rank-based Linnaean taxonomy and also reflects evolutionary relationships. Benton included the superclass Tetrapoda in the subclass Sarcopterygii in order to reflect the direct descent of tetrapods from lobe-finned fish, despite the former being assigned a higher taxonomic rank

A mammal (from Latin mamma ' breast ' ) [ 1 ] is a vertebrate animal of the class Mammalia ( / m ə ˈ m eɪ l i . ə / ). Mammals are characterised by the presence of milk -producing mammary glands for feeding their young, a broad neocortex region of the brain, fur or hair , and three middle ear bones . These characteristics distinguish them from reptiles and birds , from which their ancestors diverged in the Carboniferous Period over 300 million years ago. Around 6,640 extant species of mammals have been described and divided into 27 orders . [ 2 ] The study of mammals is called mammalogy . 

The largest orders of mammals, by number of species , are the rodents , bats , and eulipotyphlans (including hedgehogs , moles and shrews ). The next three are the primates (including humans , monkeys and lemurs ), the even-toed ungulates (including pigs , bovids and whales ), and the Carnivora (including cats , dogs , and seals ). 

Mammals are the only living members of Synapsida ; this clade , together with Sauropsida (reptiles and birds), constitutes the larger Amniota clade. Early synapsids are referred to as " pelycosaurs ." The more advanced therapsids became dominant during the Guadalupian . Mammals originated from cynodonts , an advanced group of therapsids, during the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic . Mammals achieved their modern diversity in the Paleogene and Neogene periods of the Cenozoic era, after the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs , and have been the dominant terrestrial animal group from 66 million years ago to the present. 

The basic mammalian body type is quadrupedal , with most mammals using four limbs for terrestrial locomotion ; but in some, the limbs are adapted for life at sea , in the air , in trees or underground . The bipeds have adapted to move using only the two lower limbs, while the rear limbs of cetaceans and the sea cows are mere internal vestiges . Mammals range in size from the 30–40 millimetres (1.2–1.6 in) bumblebee bat to the 30 metres (98 ft) blue whale —possibly the largest animal to have ever lived. Maximum lifespan varies from two years for the shrew to 211 years for the bowhead whale . All modern mammals give birth to live young, except the five species of monotremes , which lay eggs. The most species-rich group is the viviparous placental mammals , so named for the temporary organ ( placenta ) used by offspring to draw nutrition from the mother during gestation . 

Most mammals are intelligent , with some possessing large brains, self-awareness , and tool use . Mammals can communicate and vocalise in several ways, including the production of ultrasound , scent marking , alarm signals , singing , echolocation ; and, in the case of humans, complex language . Mammals can organise themselves into fission–fusion societies , harems , and hierarchies —but can also be solitary and territorial . Most mammals are polygynous , but some can be monogamous or polyandrous . 

Domestication of many types of mammals by humans played a major role in the Neolithic Revolution , and resulted in farming replacing hunting and gathering as the primary source of food for humans. This led to a major restructuring of human societies from nomadic to sedentary, with more co-operation among larger and larger groups, and ultimately the development of the first civilisations . Domesticated mammals provided, and continue to provide, power for transport and agriculture, as well as food ( meat and dairy products ), fur , and leather . Mammals are also hunted and raced for sport, kept as pets and working animals of various types, and are used as model organisms in science. Mammals have been depicted in art since Paleolithic times, and appear in literature, film, mythology, and religion. Decline in numbers and extinction of many mammals is primarily driven by human poaching and habitat destruction , primarily deforestation .

Mammal classification has been through several revisions since Carl Linnaeus initially defined the class, and at present [ when? ] , no classification system is universally accepted. McKenna & Bell (1997) and Wilson & Reeder (2005) provide useful recent compendiums. [ 3 ] Simpson (1945) [ 4 ] provides systematics of mammal origins and relationships that had been taught universally until the end of the 20th century.
However, since 1945, a large amount of new and more detailed information has gradually been found: The paleontological record has been recalibrated, and the intervening years have seen much debate and progress concerning the theoretical underpinnings of systematisation itself, partly through the new concept of cladistics . Though fieldwork and lab work progressively outdated Simpson's classification, it remains the closest thing to an official classification of mammals, despite its known issues. [ 5 ] 

Most mammals, including the six most species-rich orders, belong to the placental group. The three largest orders in numbers of species are Rodentia : mice , rats , porcupines , beavers , capybaras , and other gnawing mammals; Chiroptera : bats; and Eulipotyphla : shrews , moles , and solenodons . The next three biggest orders, depending on the biological classification scheme used, are the primates : apes , monkeys , and lemurs ; Cetartiodactyla : whales and even-toed ungulates ; and Carnivora which includes cats , dogs , weasels , bears , seals , and allies. [ 6 ] According to Mammal Species of the World , 5,416 species were identified in 2006. These were grouped into 1,229 genera , 153 families and 29 orders. [ 6 ] In 2008, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) completed a five-year Global Mammal Assessment for its IUCN Red List , which counted 5,488 species. [ 7 ] According to research published in the Journal of Mammalogy in 2018, the number of recognised mammal species is 6,495, including 96 recently extinct. [ 8 ] 

# Definitions 

The word " mammal " is modern, from the scientific name Mammalia coined by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, derived from the Latin mamma ("teat, pap"). In an influential 1988 paper, Timothy Rowe defined Mammalia phylogenetically as the crown group of mammals, the clade consisting of the most recent common ancestor of living monotremes ( echidnas and platypuses ) and therians ( marsupials and placentals ) and all descendants of that ancestor. [ 9 ] Since this ancestor lived in the Jurassic Period, Rowe's definition excludes all animals from the earlier Triassic , despite the fact that Triassic fossils in the Haramiyida have been referred to the Mammalia since the mid-19th century. [ 10 ] If Mammalia is considered as the crown group, its origin can be roughly dated as the first known appearance of animals more closely related to some extant mammals than to others. Ambondro is more closely related to monotremes than to therian mammals while Amphilestes and Amphitherium are more closely related to the therians; as fossils of all three genera are dated about 167 million years ago in the Middle Jurassic , this is a reasonable estimate for the appearance of the crown group. [ citation needed ] 

T. S. Kemp has provided a more traditional definition: " Synapsids that possess a dentary – squamosal jaw articulation and occlusion between upper and lower molars with a transverse component to the movement" or, equivalently in Kemp's view, the clade originating with the last common ancestor of Sinoconodon and living mammals. [ 11 ] The earliest-known synapsid satisfying Kemp's definitions is Tikitherium , dated 225 Ma , so the appearance of mammals in this broader sense can be given this Late Triassic date. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] However, this animal may have actually evolved during the Neogene. [ 14 ] 

# Molecular classification of placentals 

Genus-level molecular phylogeny of 116 extant mammals inferred from the gene tree information of 14,509 coding DNA sequences . [ 15 ] The major clades are coloured: marsupials (magenta), xenarthrans (orange), afrotherians (red), laurasiatherians (green), and euarchontoglirans (blue). 

As of the early 21st century, molecular studies based on DNA analysis have suggested new relationships among mammal families. Most of these findings have been independently validated by retrotransposon presence/absence data . [ 16 ] Classification systems based on molecular studies reveal three major groups or lineages of placentals— Afrotheria , Xenarthra and Boreoeutheria —which diverged in the Cretaceous . The relationships between these three lineages is contentious, and all three possible hypotheses have been proposed with respect to which group is basal . These hypotheses are Atlantogenata (basal Boreoeutheria), Epitheria (basal Xenarthra) and Exafroplacentalia (basal Afrotheria). [ 17 ] Boreoeutheria in turn contains two major lineages— Euarchontoglires and Laurasiatheria . 

Estimates for the divergence times between these three placental groups range from 105 to 120 million years ago, depending on the type of DNA used (such as nuclear or mitochondrial ) [ 18 ] and varying interpretations of paleogeographic data. [ 17 ]

# Evolution

# Origins 

Synapsida , a clade that contains mammals and their extinct relatives, originated during the Pennsylvanian subperiod (~323 million to ~300 million years ago), when they split from the reptile lineage. Crown group mammals evolved from earlier mammaliaforms during the Early Jurassic . The cladogram takes Mammalia to be the crown group. [ 20 ]

# Evolution from older amniotes 

The original synapsid skull structure contains one temporal opening behind the orbitals , in a fairly low position on the skull (lower right in this image). This opening might have assisted in containing the jaw muscles of these organisms which could have increased their biting strength. 

The first fully terrestrial vertebrates were amniotes . Like their amphibious early tetrapod predecessors, they had lungs and limbs. Amniotic eggs, however, have internal membranes that allow the developing embryo to breathe but keep water in. Hence, amniotes can lay eggs on dry land, while amphibians generally need to lay their eggs in water. 

The first amniotes apparently arose in the Pennsylvanian subperiod of the Carboniferous . They descended from earlier reptiliomorph amphibious tetrapods, [ 21 ] which lived on land that was already inhabited by insects and other invertebrates as well as ferns , mosses and other plants. Within a few million years, two important amniote lineages became distinct: the synapsids , which would later include the common ancestor of the mammals; and the sauropsids , which now include turtles , lizards , snakes , crocodilians and dinosaurs (including birds ). [ 22 ] Synapsids have a single hole ( temporal fenestra ) low on each side of the skull. Primitive synapsids included the largest and fiercest animals of the early Permian such as Dimetrodon . [ 23 ] Nonmammalian synapsids were traditionally—and incorrectly—called "mammal-like reptiles" or pelycosaurs ; we now know they were neither reptiles nor part of reptile lineage. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] 

Therapsids , a group of synapsids, evolved in the Middle Permian , about 265 million years ago, and became the dominant land vertebrates. [ 24 ] They differ from basal eupelycosaurs in several features of the skull and jaws, including: larger skulls and incisors which are equal in size in therapsids, but not for eupelycosaurs. [ 24 ] The therapsid lineage leading to mammals went through a series of stages, beginning with animals that were very similar to their early synapsid ancestors and ending with probainognathian cynodonts , some of which could easily be mistaken for mammals. Those stages were characterised by: [ 26 ] 

- The gradual development of a bony secondary palate . 
- Abrupt acquisition of endothermy among Mammaliamorpha , thus prior to the origin of mammals by 30–50 millions of years [ 27 ] . 
- Progression towards an erect limb posture, which would increase the animals' stamina by avoiding Carrier's constraint . But this process was slow and erratic: for example, all herbivorous nonmammaliaform therapsids retained sprawling limbs (some late forms may have had semierect hind limbs); Permian carnivorous therapsids had sprawling forelimbs, and some late Permian ones also had semisprawling hindlimbs. In fact, modern monotremes still have semisprawling limbs. 
- The dentary gradually became the main bone of the lower jaw which, by the Triassic, progressed towards the fully mammalian jaw (the lower consisting only of the dentary) and middle ear (which is constructed by the bones that were previously used to construct the jaws of reptiles). 

# First mammals 

The Permian–Triassic extinction event about 252 million years ago, which was a prolonged event due to the accumulation of several extinction pulses, ended the dominance of carnivorous therapsids. [ 28 ] In the early Triassic, most medium to large land carnivore niches were taken over by archosaurs [ 29 ] which, over an extended period (35 million years), came to include the crocodylomorphs , [ 30 ] the pterosaurs and the dinosaurs; [ 31 ] however, large cynodonts like Trucidocynodon and traversodontids still occupied large sized carnivorous and herbivorous niches respectively. By the Jurassic, the dinosaurs had come to dominate the large terrestrial herbivore niches as well. [ 32 ] 

The first mammals (in Kemp's sense) appeared in the Late Triassic epoch (about 225 million years ago), 40 million years after the first therapsids. They expanded out of their nocturnal insectivore niche from the mid-Jurassic onwards; [ 33 ] the Jurassic Castorocauda , for example, was a close relative of true mammals that had adaptations for swimming, digging and catching fish. [ 34 ] Most, if not all, are thought to have remained nocturnal (the nocturnal bottleneck ), accounting for much of the typical mammalian traits. [ 35 ] The majority of the mammal species that existed in the Mesozoic Era were multituberculates, eutriconodonts and spalacotheriids . [ 36 ] The earliest-known fossil of the Metatheria ("changed beasts") is Sinodelphys , found in 125-million-year-old Early Cretaceous shale in China's northeastern Liaoning Province . The fossil is nearly complete and includes tufts of fur and imprints of soft tissues. [ 37 ] 
Restoration of Juramaia sinensis , the oldest-known eutherian (160 mya) [ 38 ] 

The oldest-known fossil among the Eutheria ("true beasts") is the small shrewlike Juramaia sinensis , or "Jurassic mother from China", dated to 160 million years ago in the late Jurassic. [ 38 ] A later eutherian relative, Eomaia , dated to 125 million years ago in the early Cretaceous, possessed some features in common with the marsupials but not with the placentals, evidence that these features were present in the last common ancestor of the two groups but were later lost in the placental lineage. [ 39 ] In particular, the epipubic bones extend forwards from the pelvis. These are not found in any modern placental, but they are found in marsupials, monotremes, other nontherian mammals and Ukhaatherium , an early Cretaceous animal in the eutherian order Asioryctitheria . This also applies to the multituberculates. [ 40 ] They are apparently an ancestral feature, which subsequently disappeared in the placental lineage. These epipubic bones seem to function by stiffening the muscles during locomotion, reducing the amount of space being presented, which placentals require to contain their fetus during gestation periods. A narrow pelvic outlet indicates that the young were very small at birth and therefore pregnancy was short, as in modern marsupials. This suggests that the placenta was a later development. [ 41 ] 

One of the earliest-known monotremes was Teinolophos , which lived about 120 million years ago in Australia. [ 42 ] Monotremes have some features which may be inherited from the original amniotes such as the same orifice to urinate, defecate and reproduce ( cloaca )—as reptiles and birds also do— [ 43 ] and they lay eggs which are leathery and uncalcified. [ 44 ] 

# Earliest appearances of features 

Hadrocodium , whose fossils date from approximately 195 million years ago, in the early Jurassic , provides the first clear evidence of a jaw joint formed solely by the squamosal and dentary bones; there is no space in the jaw for the articular, a bone involved in the jaws of all early synapsids. [ 45 ] 
Fossil of Thrinaxodon at the National Museum of Natural History 

The earliest clear evidence of hair or fur is in fossils of Castorocauda and Megaconus , from 164 million years ago in the mid-Jurassic. In the 1950s, it was suggested that the foramina (passages) in the maxillae and premaxillae (bones in the front of the upper jaw) of cynodonts were channels which supplied blood vessels and nerves to vibrissae ( whiskers ) and so were evidence of hair or fur; [ 46 ] [ 47 ] it was soon pointed out, however, that foramina do not necessarily show that an animal had vibrissae, as the modern lizard Tupinambis has foramina that are almost identical to those found in the nonmammalian cynodont Thrinaxodon . [ 25 ] [ 48 ] Popular sources, nevertheless, continue to attribute whiskers to Thrinaxodon . [ 49 ] Studies on Permian coprolites suggest that non-mammalian synapsids of the epoch already had fur, setting the evolution of hairs possibly as far back as dicynodonts . [ 50 ] 

When endothermy first appeared in the evolution of mammals is uncertain, though it is generally agreed to have first evolved in non-mammalian therapsids . [ 50 ] [ 51 ] Modern monotremes have lower body temperatures and more variable metabolic rates than marsupials and placentals, [ 52 ] but there is evidence that some of their ancestors, perhaps including ancestors of the therians, may have had body temperatures like those of modern therians. [ 53 ] Likewise, some modern therians like afrotheres and xenarthrans have secondarily developed lower body temperatures. [ 54 ] 

The evolution of erect limbs in mammals is incomplete—living and fossil monotremes have sprawling limbs. The parasagittal (nonsprawling) limb posture appeared sometime in the late Jurassic or early Cretaceous; it is found in the eutherian Eomaia and the metatherian Sinodelphys , both dated to 125 million years ago. [ 55 ] Epipubic bones, a feature that strongly influenced the reproduction of most mammal clades, are first found in Tritylodontidae , suggesting that it is a synapomorphy between them and Mammaliaformes . They are omnipresent in non-placental Mammaliaformes, though Megazostrodon and Erythrotherium appear to have lacked them. [ 56 ] 

It has been suggested that the original function of lactation ( milk production) was to keep eggs moist. Much of the argument is based on monotremes, the egg-laying mammals. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] In human females, mammary glands become fully developed during puberty, regardless of pregnancy. [ 59 ] 

# Rise of the mammals 

Hyaenodon horridus at the Royal Ontario Museum . The genus Hyaenodon was among the most successful mammals of the late Eocene -early Miocene epochs spanning for most of the Paleogene and some of the Neogene periods, undergoing many endemic radiations in North America, Europe, and Asia. [ 60 ] 

Therians took over the medium- to large-sized ecological niches in the Cenozoic , after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event approximately 66 million years ago emptied ecological space once filled by non-avian dinosaurs and other groups of reptiles, as well as various other mammal groups, [ 61 ] and underwent an exponential increase in body size ( megafauna ). [ 62 ] The increase in mammalian diversity was not, however, solely because of expansion into large-bodied niches. [ 63 ] Mammals diversified very quickly, displaying an exponential rise in diversity. [ 61 ] For example, the earliest-known bat dates from about 50 million years ago, only 16 million years after the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. [ 64 ] 

Molecular phylogenetic studies initially suggested that most placental orders diverged about 100 to 85 million years ago and that modern families appeared in the period from the late Eocene through the Miocene . [ 65 ] However, no placental fossils have been found from before the end of the Cretaceous. [ 66 ] The earliest undisputed fossils of placentals come from the early Paleocene , after the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. [ 66 ] (Scientists identified an early Paleocene animal named Protungulatum donnae as one of the first placental mammals, [ 67 ] but it has since been reclassified as a non-placental eutherian.) [ 68 ] Recalibrations of genetic and morphological diversity rates have suggested a Late Cretaceous origin for placentals, and a Paleocene origin for most modern clades. [ 69 ] 

The earliest-known ancestor of primates is Archicebus achilles [ 70 ] from around 55 million years ago. [ 70 ] This tiny primate weighed 20–30 grams (0.7–1.1 ounce) and could fit within a human palm. [ 70 ] 

# Anatomy 

# Distinguishing features 

Living mammal species can be identified by the presence of sweat glands , including those that are specialised to produce milk to nourish their young. [ 71 ] In classifying fossils, however, other features must be used, since soft tissue glands and many other features are not visible in fossils. [ 72 ] 

Many traits shared by all living mammals appeared among the earliest members of the group: 

- Jaw joint – The dentary (the lower jaw bone, which carries the teeth) and the squamosal (a small cranial bone) meet to form the joint. In most gnathostomes , including early therapsids , the joint consists of the articular (a small bone at the back of the lower jaw) and quadrate (a small bone at the back of the upper jaw). [ 45 ] 
- Middle ear – In crown-group mammals, sound is carried from the eardrum by a chain of three bones, the malleus , the incus and the stapes . Ancestrally, the malleus and the incus are derived from the articular and the quadrate bones that constituted the jaw joint of early therapsids. [ 73 ] 
- Tooth replacement – Teeth can be replaced once ( diphyodonty ) or (as in toothed whales and murid rodents) not at all ( monophyodonty ). [ 74 ] Elephants, manatees, and kangaroos continually grow new teeth throughout their life ( polyphyodonty ). [ 75 ] 
- Prismatic enamel – The enamel coating on the surface of a tooth consists of prisms, solid, rod-like structures extending from the dentin to the tooth's surface. [ 76 ] 
- Occipital condyles – Two knobs at the base of the skull fit into the topmost neck vertebra ; most other tetrapods , in contrast, have only one such knob. [ 77 ] 

For the most part, these characteristics were not present in the Triassic ancestors of the mammals. [ 78 ] Nearly all mammaliaforms possess an epipubic bone, the exception being modern placentals. [ 79 ] 

# Sexual dimorphism 

Sexual dimorphism in aurochs , the extinct wild ancestor of cattle 

On average, male mammals are larger than females, with males being at least 10% larger than females in over 45% of investigated species. Most mammalian orders also exhibit male-biased sexual dimorphism , although some orders do not show any bias or are significantly female-biased ( Lagomorpha ). Sexual size dimorphism increases with body size across mammals ( Rensch's rule ), suggesting that there are parallel selection pressures on both male and female size. Male-biased dimorphism relates to sexual selection on males through male–male competition for females, as there is a positive correlation between the degree of sexual selection, as indicated by mating systems , and the degree of male-biased size dimorphism. The degree of sexual selection is also positively correlated with male and female size across mammals. Further, parallel selection pressure on female mass is identified in that age at weaning is significantly higher in more polygynous species, even when correcting for body mass. Also, the reproductive rate is lower for larger females, indicating that fecundity selection selects for smaller females in mammals. Although these patterns hold across mammals as a whole, there is considerable variation across orders. [ 80 ] 

# Biological systems 

Main article: Biological system 

The majority of mammals have seven cervical vertebrae (bones in the neck). The exceptions are the manatee and the two-toed sloth , which have six, and the three-toed sloth which has nine. [ 81 ] All mammalian brains possess a neocortex , a brain region unique to mammals. [ 82 ] Placental brains have a corpus callosum , unlike monotremes and marsupials. [ 83 ] 

Didactic models of a mammalian heart 

# Circulatory systems 

The mammalian heart has four chambers, two upper atria , the receiving chambers, and two lower ventricles , the discharging chambers. [ 84 ] The heart has four valves, which separate its chambers and ensures blood flows in the correct direction through the heart (preventing backflow). After gas exchange in the pulmonary capillaries (blood vessels in the lungs), oxygen-rich blood returns to the left atrium via one of the four pulmonary veins . Blood flows nearly continuously back into the atrium, which acts as the receiving chamber, and from here through an opening into the left ventricle. Most blood flows passively into the heart while both the atria and ventricles are relaxed, but toward the end of the ventricular relaxation period , the left atrium will contract, pumping blood into the ventricle. The heart also requires nutrients and oxygen found in blood like other muscles, and is supplied via coronary arteries . [ 85 ] The red blood cells of mammals also lack a nucleus to make space for more haemoglobin , which significantly increases the cell's oxygen-carrying capacity. [ 86 ] 

# Respiratory systems 

Raccoon lungs being inflated manually 

Main article: Respiratory system § Mammals 

The lungs of mammals are spongy and honeycombed. Breathing is mainly achieved with the diaphragm , which divides the thorax from the abdominal cavity, forming a dome convex to the thorax. Contraction of the diaphragm flattens the dome, increasing the volume of the lung cavity. Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities, and travels through the larynx, trachea and bronchi , and expands the alveoli . Relaxing the diaphragm has the opposite effect, decreasing the volume of the lung cavity, causing air to be pushed out of the lungs. During exercise, the abdominal wall contracts , increasing pressure on the diaphragm, which forces air out quicker and more forcefully. The rib cage is able to expand and contract the chest cavity through the action of other respiratory muscles. Consequently, air is sucked into or expelled out of the lungs, always moving down its pressure gradient. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] This type of lung is known as a bellows lung due to its resemblance to blacksmith bellows . [ 88 ] 

# Integumentary systems 

Mammal skin: (1) hair , (2) epidermis , (3) sebaceous gland , (4) Arrector pili muscle , (5) dermis , (6) hair follicle , (7) sweat gland . Not labelled, the bottom layer: hypodermis , showing round adipocytes 

The integumentary system (skin) is made up of three layers: the outermost epidermis , the dermis and the hypodermis . The epidermis is typically 10 to 30 cells thick; its main function is to provide a waterproof layer. Its outermost cells are constantly lost; its bottommost cells are constantly dividing and pushing upward. The middle layer, the dermis, is 15 to 40 times thicker than the epidermis. The dermis is made up of many components, such as bony structures and blood vessels. The hypodermis is made up of adipose tissue , which stores lipids and provides cushioning and insulation. The thickness of this layer varies widely from species to species; [ 89 ] : 97 marine mammals require a thick hypodermis ( blubber ) for insulation, and right whales have the thickest blubber at 20 inches (51 cm). [ 90 ] Although other animals have features such as whiskers, feathers , setae , or cilia that superficially resemble it, no animals other than mammals have hair . It is a definitive characteristic of the class, though some mammals have very little. [ 89 ] : 61 

# Digestive systems 

The carnassials (teeth in the very back of the mouth) of the insectivorous aardwolf (left) versus that of a grey wolf (right) which consumes large vertebrates 

Herbivores have developed a diverse range of physical structures to facilitate the consumption of plant material . To break up intact plant tissues, mammals have developed teeth structures that reflect their feeding preferences. For instance, frugivores (animals that feed primarily on fruit) and herbivores that feed on soft foliage have low-crowned teeth specialised for grinding foliage and seeds . Grazing animals that tend to eat hard, silica -rich grasses, have high-crowned teeth, which are capable of grinding tough plant tissues and do not wear down as quickly as low-crowned teeth. [ 91 ] Most carnivorous mammals have carnassial teeth (of varying length depending on diet), long canines and similar tooth replacement patterns. [ 92 ] 

The stomach of even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyla) is divided into four sections: the rumen , the reticulum , the omasum and the abomasum (only ruminants have a rumen). After the plant material is consumed, it is mixed with saliva in the rumen and reticulum and separates into solid and liquid material. The solids lump together to form a bolus (or cud ), and is regurgitated. When the bolus enters the mouth, the fluid is squeezed out with the tongue and swallowed again. Ingested food passes to the rumen and reticulum where cellulolytic microbes ( bacteria , protozoa and fungi ) produce cellulase , which is needed to break down the cellulose in plants. [ 93 ] Perissodactyls , in contrast to the ruminants, store digested food that has left the stomach in an enlarged cecum , where it is fermented by bacteria. [ 94 ] Carnivora have a simple stomach adapted to digest primarily meat, as compared to the elaborate digestive systems of herbivorous animals, which are necessary to break down tough, complex plant fibres. The cecum is either absent or short and simple, and the large intestine is not sacculated or much wider than the small intestine. [ 95 ] 

# Excretory and genitourinary systems 

Bovine kidney Genitourinary system of a male and female rabbit 

The mammalian excretory system involves many components. Like amphibians, mammals are ureotelic , and convert ammonia into urea , which is done by the liver as part of the urea cycle . [ 96 ] Bilirubin , a waste product derived from blood cells , is passed through bile and urine with the help of enzymes excreted by the liver. [ 97 ] The passing of bilirubin via bile through the intestinal tract gives mammalian feces a distinctive brown coloration. [ 98 ] Distinctive features of the mammalian kidney include the presence of the renal pelvis and renal pyramids , and of a clearly distinguishable cortex and medulla , which is due to the presence of elongated loops of Henle . Only the mammalian kidney has a bean shape, although there are some exceptions, such as the multilobed reniculate kidneys of pinnipeds, cetaceans and bears. [ 99 ] [ 100 ] Most adult placentals have no remaining trace of the cloaca . In the embryo, the embryonic cloaca divides into a posterior region that becomes part of the anus , and an anterior region that has different fates depending on the sex of the individual: in females, it develops into the vestibule or urogenital sinus that receives the urethra and vagina , while in males it forms the entirety of the penile urethra . [ 100 ] [ 101 ] However, the afrosoricids and some shrews retain a cloaca as adults. [ 102 ] In marsupials, the genital tract is separate from the anus, but a trace of the original cloaca does remain externally. [ 100 ] Monotremes, which translates from Greek into "single hole", have a true cloaca. [ 103 ] Urine flows from the ureters into the cloaca in monotremes and into the bladder in placentals. [ 100 ] 

# Sound production 

A diagram of ultrasonic signals emitted by a bat, and the echo from a nearby object 

As in all other tetrapods, mammals have a larynx that can quickly open and close to produce sounds, and a supralaryngeal vocal tract which filters this sound. The lungs and surrounding musculature provide the air stream and pressure required to phonate . The larynx controls the pitch and volume of sound, but the strength the lungs exert to exhale also contributes to volume. More primitive mammals, such as the echidna, can only hiss, as sound is achieved solely through exhaling through a partially closed larynx. Other mammals phonate using vocal folds . The movement or tenseness of the vocal folds can result in many sounds such as purring and screaming . Mammals can change the position of the larynx, allowing them to breathe through the nose while swallowing through the mouth, and to form both oral and nasal sounds; nasal sounds, such as a dog whine, are generally soft sounds, and oral sounds, such as a dog bark, are generally loud. [ 104 ] 
Beluga whale echolocation sounds 

Some mammals have a large larynx and thus a low-pitched voice, namely the hammer-headed bat ( Hypsignathus monstrosus ) where the larynx can take up the entirety of the thoracic cavity while pushing the lungs, heart, and trachea into the abdomen . [ 105 ] Large vocal pads can also lower the pitch, as in the low-pitched roars of big cats . [ 106 ] The production of infrasound is possible in some mammals such as the African elephant ( Loxodonta spp.) and baleen whales . [ 107 ] [ 108 ] Small mammals with small larynxes have the ability to produce ultrasound , which can be detected by modifications to the middle ear and cochlea . Ultrasound is inaudible to birds and reptiles, which might have been important during the Mesozoic, when birds and reptiles were the dominant predators. This private channel is used by some rodents in, for example, mother-to-pup communication, and by bats when echolocating. Toothed whales also use echolocation, but, as opposed to the vocal membrane that extends upward from the vocal folds, they have a melon to manipulate sounds. Some mammals, namely the primates, have air sacs attached to the larynx, which may function to lower the resonances or increase the volume of sound. [ 104 ] 

The vocal production system is controlled by the cranial nerve nuclei in the brain, and supplied by the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the superior laryngeal nerve , branches of the vagus nerve . The vocal tract is supplied by the hypoglossal nerve and facial nerves . Electrical stimulation of the periaqueductal grey (PEG) region of the mammalian midbrain elicit vocalisations. The ability to learn new vocalisations is only exemplified in humans, seals, cetaceans, elephants and possibly bats; in humans, this is the result of a direct connection between the motor cortex , which controls movement, and the motor neurons in the spinal cord. [ 104 ] 

# Fur 

Main article: Fur 
Porcupines use their spines for defence. 

The primary function of the fur of mammals is thermoregulation . Others include protection, sensory purposes, waterproofing, and camouflage. [ 109 ] Different types of fur serve different purposes: [ 89 ] : 99 

- Definitive – which may be shed after reaching a certain length 
- Vibrissae – sensory hairs, most commonly whiskers 
- Pelage – guard hairs, under-fur, and awn hair 
- Spines – stiff guard hair used for defence (such as in porcupines ) 
- Bristles – long hairs usually used in visual signals. (such as a lion's mane ) 
- Velli – often called "down fur" which insulates newborn mammals 
- Wool – long, soft and often curly 

# Thermoregulation 

Hair length is not a factor in thermoregulation: for example, some tropical mammals such as sloths have the same length of fur length as some arctic mammals but with less insulation; and, conversely, other tropical mammals with short hair have the same insulating value as arctic mammals. The denseness of fur can increase an animal's insulation value, and arctic mammals especially have dense fur; for example, the musk ox has guard hairs measuring 30 cm (12 in) as well as a dense underfur, which forms an airtight coat, allowing them to survive in temperatures of −40 °C (−40 °F). [ 89 ] : 162–163 Some desert mammals, such as camels, use dense fur to prevent solar heat from reaching their skin, allowing the animal to stay cool; a camel's fur may reach 70 °C (158 °F) in the summer, but the skin stays at 40 °C (104 °F). [ 89 ] : 188 Aquatic mammals , conversely, trap air in their fur to conserve heat by keeping the skin dry. [ 89 ] : 162–163

# Coloration 

Mammalian coats are coloured for a variety of reasons, the major selective pressures including camouflage , sexual selection , communication, and thermoregulation. Coloration in both the hair and skin of mammals is mainly determined by the type and amount of melanin ; eumelanins for brown and black colours and pheomelanin for a range of yellowish to reddish colours, giving mammals an earth tone . [ 110 ] [ 111 ] Some mammals have more vibrant colours; certain monkeys such mandrills and vervet monkeys , and opossums such as the Mexican mouse opossums and Derby's woolly opossums , have blue skin due to light diffraction in collagen fibres. [ 112 ] Many sloths appear green because their fur hosts green algae ; this may be a symbiotic relation that affords camouflage to the sloths. [ 113 ] 

Camouflage is a powerful influence in a large number of mammals, as it helps to conceal individuals from predators or prey. [ 114 ] In arctic and subarctic mammals such as the arctic fox ( Alopex lagopus ), collared lemming ( Dicrostonyx groenlandicus ), stoat ( Mustela erminea ), and snowshoe hare ( Lepus americanus ), seasonal color change between brown in summer and white in winter is driven largely by camouflage. [ 115 ] Some arboreal mammals, notably primates and marsupials, have shades of violet, green, or blue skin on parts of their bodies, indicating some distinct advantage in their largely arboreal habitat due to convergent evolution . [ 112 ] 

Aposematism , warning off possible predators, is the most likely explanation of the black-and-white pelage of many mammals which are able to defend themselves, such as in the foul-smelling skunk and the powerful and aggressive honey badger . [ 116 ] Coat color is sometimes sexually dimorphic , as in many primate species . [ 117 ] Differences in female and male coat color may indicate nutrition and hormone levels, important in mate selection. [ 118 ] Coat color may influence the ability to retain heat, depending on how much light is reflected. Mammals with a darker coloured coat can absorb more heat from solar radiation, and stay warmer, and some smaller mammals, such as voles , have darker fur in the winter. The white, pigmentless fur of arctic mammals, such as the polar bear, may reflect more solar radiation directly onto the skin. [ 89 ] : 166–167 [ 109 ] The dazzling black-and-white striping of zebras appear to provide some protection from biting flies. [ 119 ] 

# Reproductive system 

Main article: Mammalian reproduction 
Goat kids stay with their mother until they are weaned. 

Mammals reproduce by internal fertilisation [ 120 ] and are solely gonochoric (an animal is born with either male or female genitalia, as opposed to hermaphrodites where there is no such schism). [ 121 ] Male mammals ejaculate semen during copulation through a penis , which may be contained in a prepuce when not erect. Male placentals also urinate through a penis, and some placentals also have a penis bone ( baculum ). [ 122 ] [ 123 ] [ 120 ] Marsupials typically have forked penises, [ 124 ] while the echidna penis generally has four heads with only two functioning. [ 125 ] Depending on the species, an erection may be fuelled by blood flow into vascular, spongy tissue or by muscular action. [ 122 ] The testicles of most mammals descend into the scrotum which is typically posterior to the penis but is often anterior in marsupials. Female mammals generally have a vulva ( clitoris and labia ) on the outside, while the internal system contains paired oviducts , one or two uteri , one or two cervices and a vagina . [ 126 ] [ 127 ] Marsupials have two lateral vaginas and a medial vagina. The "vagina" of monotremes is better understood as a "urogenital sinus". The uterine systems of placentals can vary between a duplex, where there are two uteri and cervices which open into the vagina, a bipartite, where two uterine horns have a single cervix that connects to the vagina, a bicornuate, which consists where two uterine horns that are connected distally but separate medially creating a Y-shape, and a simplex, which has a single uterus. [ 128 ] [ 129 ] [ 89 ] : 220–221, 247 
Matschie's tree-kangaroo with young in pouch 

The ancestral condition for mammal reproduction is the birthing of relatively undeveloped young, either through direct vivipary or a short period as soft-shelled eggs. This is likely due to the fact that the torso could not expand due to the presence of epipubic bones . The oldest demonstration of this reproductive style is with Kayentatherium , which produced undeveloped perinates , but at much higher litter sizes than any modern mammal, 38 specimens. [ 130 ] Most modern mammals are viviparous , giving birth to live young. However, the five species of monotreme, the platypus and the four species of echidna, lay eggs. The monotremes have a sex-determination system different from that of most other mammals. [ 131 ] In particular, the sex chromosomes of a platypus are more like those of a chicken than those of a therian mammal. [ 132 ] 

Viviparous mammals are in the subclass Theria; those living today are in the marsupial and placental infraclasses. Marsupials have a short gestation period, typically shorter than its estrous cycle and generally giving birth to a number of undeveloped newborns that then undergo further development; in many species, this takes place within a pouch-like sac, the marsupium , located in the front of the mother's abdomen . This is the plesiomorphic condition among viviparous mammals; the presence of epipubic bones in all non-placentals prevents the expansion of the torso needed for full pregnancy. [ 79 ] Even non-placental eutherians probably reproduced this way. [ 40 ] The placentals give birth to relatively complete and developed young, usually after long gestation periods. [ 133 ] They get their name from the placenta , which connects the developing fetus to the uterine wall to allow nutrient uptake. [ 134 ] In placentals, the epipubic is either completely lost or converted into the baculum; allowing the torso to be able to expand and thus birth developed offspring. [ 130 ] The great majority of mammals give birth multiple times during their lifespan, but a few species are semelparous . [ citation needed ] 

The mammary glands of mammals are specialised to produce milk, the primary source of nutrition for newborns. The monotremes branched early from other mammals and do not have the teats seen in most mammals, but they do have mammary glands. The young lick the milk from a mammary patch on the mother's belly. [ 135 ] Compared to placental mammals, the milk of marsupials changes greatly in both production rate and in nutrient composition, due to the underdeveloped young. In addition, the mammary glands have more autonomy allowing them to supply separate milks to young at different development stages. [ 136 ] Lactose is the main sugar in placental milk while monotreme and marsupial milk is dominated by oligosaccharides . [ 137 ] Weaning is the process in which a mammal becomes less dependent on their mother's milk and more on solid food. [ 138 ] 

# Endothermy 

Nearly all mammals are endothermic ("warm-blooded"). Most mammals also have hair to help keep them warm. Like birds, mammals can forage or hunt in weather and climates too cold for ectothermic ("cold-blooded") reptiles and insects. Endothermy requires plenty of food energy, so mammals eat more food per unit of body weight than most reptiles. [ 139 ] Small insectivorous mammals eat prodigious amounts for their size. A rare exception, the naked mole-rat produces little metabolic heat, so it is considered an operational poikilotherm . [ 140 ] Birds are also endothermic, so endothermy is not unique to mammals. [ 141 ] 

# Species lifespan 

See also: Life expectancy and Maximum life span 

Among mammals, species maximum lifespan varies significantly from one year in the yellow-sided opossum [ citation needed ] to 211 years in the oldest bowhead whale recorded. [ 142 ] Although the underlying basis for these lifespan differences is still uncertain, numerous studies indicate that the ability to repair DNA damage is an important determinant of mammalian lifespan. In a 1974 study by Hart and Setlow, [ 143 ] it was found that DNA excision repair capability increased systematically with species lifespan among seven mammalian species. Species lifespan was observed to be robustly correlated with the capacity to recognise DNA double-strand breaks as well as the level of the DNA repair protein Ku80 . [ 142 ] In a study of the cells from sixteen mammalian species, genes employed in DNA repair were found to be up-regulated in the longer-lived species. [ 144 ] The cellular level of the DNA repair enzyme poly ADP ribose polymerase was found to correlate with species lifespan in a study of 13 mammalian species. [ 145 ] Three additional studies of a variety of mammalian species also reported a correlation between species lifespan and DNA repair capability. [ 146 ] [ 147 ] [ 148 ] 

# Locomotion 

Main article: Animal locomotion 

# Terrestrial 

Main article: Terrestrial locomotion 
Running gait . Photographs by Eadweard Muybridge , 1887 

Most vertebrates are plantigrade , walking on the whole of the underside of the foot. Many mammals, such as cats and dogs, are digitigrade , walking on their toes, the greater stride length allowing more speed. Some animals such as horses are unguligrade , walking on the tips of their toes. This even further increases their stride length and thus their speed. [ 149 ] A few mammals, namely the great apes, are also known to walk on their knuckles , at least for their front legs. Giant anteaters [ 150 ] and platypuses [ 151 ] are also knuckle-walkers. Some mammals are bipeds , using only two limbs for locomotion, which can be seen in, for example, humans and the great apes. Bipedal species have a larger field of vision than quadrupeds, conserve more energy and have the ability to manipulate objects with their hands, which aids in foraging. Instead of walking, some bipeds hop, such as kangaroos and kangaroo rats . [ 152 ] [ 153 ] 

Animals will use different gaits for different speeds, terrain and situations. For example, horses show four natural gaits, the slowest horse gait is the walk , then there are three faster gaits which, from slowest to fastest, are the trot , the canter and the gallop . Animals may also have unusual gaits that are used occasionally, such as for moving sideways or backwards. For example, the main human gaits are bipedal walking and running , but they employ many other gaits occasionally, including a four-legged crawl in tight spaces. [ 154 ] Mammals show a vast range of gaits , the order that they place and lift their appendages in locomotion. Gaits can be grouped into categories according to their patterns of support sequence. For quadrupeds, there are three main categories: walking gaits, running gaits and leaping gaits . [ 155 ] Walking is the most common gait, where some feet are on the ground at any given time, and found in almost all legged animals. Running is considered to occur when at some points in the stride all feet are off the ground in a moment of suspension. [ 154 ] 

# Arboreal 

Main article: Arboreal locomotion 
Gibbons are very good brachiators because their elongated limbs enable them to easily swing and grasp on to branches. 

Arboreal animals frequently have elongated limbs that help them cross gaps, reach fruit or other resources, test the firmness of support ahead and, in some cases, to brachiate (swing between trees). [ 156 ] Many arboreal species, such as tree porcupines, silky anteaters , spider monkeys, and possums , use prehensile tails to grasp branches. In the spider monkey, the tip of the tail has either a bare patch or adhesive pad, which provides increased friction. Claws can be used to interact with rough substrates and reorient the direction of forces the animal applies. This is what allows squirrels to climb tree trunks that are so large to be essentially flat from the perspective of such a small animal. However, claws can interfere with an animal's ability to grasp very small branches, as they may wrap too far around and prick the animal's own paw. Frictional gripping is used by primates, relying upon hairless fingertips. Squeezing the branch between the fingertips generates frictional force that holds the animal's hand to the branch. However, this type of grip depends upon the angle of the frictional force, thus upon the diameter of the branch, with larger branches resulting in reduced gripping ability. To control descent, especially down large diameter branches, some arboreal animals such as squirrels have evolved highly mobile ankle joints that permit rotating the foot into a 'reversed' posture. This allows the claws to hook into the rough surface of the bark, opposing the force of gravity. Small size provides many advantages to arboreal species: such as increasing the relative size of branches to the animal, lower center of mass, increased stability, lower mass (allowing movement on smaller branches) and the ability to move through more cluttered habitat. [ 156 ] Size relating to weight affects gliding animals such as the sugar glider . [ 157 ] Some species of primate, bat and all species of sloth achieve passive stability by hanging beneath the branch. Both pitching and tipping become irrelevant, as the only method of failure would be losing their grip. [ 156 ] 

# Aerial 

Main article: Aerial locomotion 
Slow-motion and normal speed of Egyptian fruit bats flying 

Bats are the only mammals that can truly fly. They fly through the air at a constant speed by moving their wings up and down (usually with some fore-aft movement as well). Because the animal is in motion, there is some airflow relative to its body which, combined with the velocity of the wings, generates a faster airflow moving over the wing. This generates a lift force vector pointing forwards and upwards, and a drag force vector pointing rearwards and upwards. The upwards components of these counteract gravity, keeping the body in the air, while the forward component provides thrust to counteract both the drag from the wing and from the body as a whole. [ 158 ] 

The wings of bats are much thinner and consist of more bones than those of birds, allowing bats to manoeuvre more accurately and fly with more lift and less drag. [ 159 ] [ 160 ] By folding the wings inwards towards their body on the upstroke, they use 35% less energy during flight than birds. [ 161 ] The membranes are delicate, ripping easily; however, the tissue of the bat's membrane is able to regrow, such that small tears can heal quickly. [ 162 ] The surface of their wings is equipped with touch-sensitive receptors on small bumps called Merkel cells , also found on human fingertips. These sensitive areas are different in bats, as each bump has a tiny hair in the center, making it even more sensitive and allowing the bat to detect and collect information about the air flowing over its wings, and to fly more efficiently by changing the shape of its wings in response. [ 163 ] 

# Fossorial and subterranean 

See also: Fossorial and Burrow 

Semi-fossorial wombat (left) vs. fully fossorial eastern mole (right) 

A fossorial (from Latin fossor , meaning "digger") is an animal adapted to digging which lives primarily, but not solely, underground. Some examples are badgers , and naked mole-rats . Many rodent species are also considered fossorial because they live in burrows for most but not all of the day. Species that live exclusively underground are subterranean, and those with limited adaptations to a fossorial lifestyle sub-fossorial. Some organisms are fossorial to aid in temperature regulation while others use the underground habitat for protection from predators or for food storage . [ 164 ] 

Fossorial mammals have a fusiform body, thickest at the shoulders and tapering off at the tail and nose. Unable to see in the dark burrows, most have degenerated eyes, but degeneration varies between species; pocket gophers , for example, are only semi-fossorial and have very small yet functional eyes, in the fully fossorial marsupial mole , the eyes are degenerated and useless, Talpa moles have vestigial eyes and the Cape golden mole has a layer of skin covering the eyes. External ears flaps are also very small or absent. Truly fossorial mammals have short, stout legs as strength is more important than speed to a burrowing mammal, but semi-fossorial mammals have cursorial legs. The front paws are broad and have strong claws to help in loosening dirt while excavating burrows, and the back paws have webbing, as well as claws, which aids in throwing loosened dirt backwards. Most have large incisors to prevent dirt from flying into their mouth. [ 165 ] 

Many fossorial mammals such as shrews, hedgehogs, and moles were classified under the now obsolete order Insectivora . [ 166 ] 

# Aquatic 

Main articles: Aquatic locomotion , Marine mammal , and Aquatic mammal 
A pod of short-beaked common dolphins swimming 

Fully aquatic mammals, the cetaceans and sirenians , have lost their legs and have a tail fin to propel themselves through the water. Flipper movement is continuous. Whales swim by moving their tail fin and lower body up and down, propelling themselves through vertical movement, while their flippers are mainly used for steering. Their skeletal anatomy allows them to be fast swimmers. Most species have a dorsal fin to prevent themselves from turning upside-down in the water. [ 167 ] [ 168 ] The flukes of sirenians are raised up and down in long strokes to move the animal forward, and can be twisted to turn. The forelimbs are paddle-like flippers which aid in turning and slowing. [ 169 ] 

Semi-aquatic mammals, like pinnipeds, have two pairs of flippers on the front and back, the fore-flippers and hind-flippers. The elbows and ankles are enclosed within the body. [ 170 ] [ 171 ] Pinnipeds have several adaptions for reducing drag . In addition to their streamlined bodies, they have smooth networks of muscle bundles in their skin that may increase laminar flow and make it easier for them to slip through water. They also lack arrector pili , so their fur can be streamlined as they swim. [ 172 ] They rely on their fore-flippers for locomotion in a wing-like manner similar to penguins and sea turtles . [ 173 ] Fore-flipper movement is not continuous, and the animal glides between each stroke. [ 171 ] Compared to terrestrial carnivorans, the fore-limbs are reduced in length, which gives the locomotor muscles at the shoulder and elbow joints greater mechanical advantage; [ 170 ] the hind-flippers serve as stabilizers. [ 172 ] Other semi-aquatic mammals include beavers, hippopotamuses , otters and platypuses. [ 174 ] Hippos are very large semi-aquatic mammals, and their barrel-shaped bodies have graviportal skeletal structures, [ 175 ] adapted to carrying their enormous weight, and their specific gravity allows them to sink and move along the bottom of a river. [ 176 ] 

# Behavior 

# Communication and vocalisation 

Further information: Animal communication and Animal echolocation 
Vervet monkeys use at least four distinct alarm calls for different predators . [ 177 ] 

Many mammals communicate by vocalising. Vocal communication serves many purposes, including in mating rituals, as warning calls , [ 178 ] to indicate food sources, and for social purposes. Males often call during mating rituals to ward off other males and to attract females, as in the roaring of lions and red deer . [ 179 ] The songs of the humpback whale may be signals to females; [ 180 ] they have different dialects in different regions of the ocean. [ 181 ] Social vocalisations include the territorial calls of gibbons , and the use of frequency in greater spear-nosed bats to distinguish between groups. [ 182 ] The vervet monkey gives a distinct alarm call for each of at least four different predators, and the reactions of other monkeys vary according to the call. For example, if an alarm call signals a python, the monkeys climb into the trees, whereas the eagle alarm causes monkeys to seek a hiding place on the ground. [ 177 ] Prairie dogs similarly have complex calls that signal the type, size, and speed of an approaching predator. [ 183 ] Elephants communicate socially with a variety of sounds including snorting, screaming, trumpeting, roaring and rumbling. Some of the rumbling calls are infrasonic , below the hearing range of humans, and can be heard by other elephants up to 6 miles (9.7 km) away at still times near sunrise and sunset. [ 184 ] 
Orca calling including occasional echolocation clicks 

Mammals signal by a variety of means. Many give visual anti-predator signals , as when deer and gazelle stot , honestly indicating their fit condition and their ability to escape, [ 185 ] [ 186 ] or when white-tailed deer and other prey mammals flag with conspicuous tail markings when alarmed, informing the predator that it has been detected. [ 187 ] Many mammals make use of scent-marking , sometimes possibly to help defend territory, but probably with a range of functions both within and between species. [ 188 ] [ 189 ] [ 190 ] Microbats and toothed whales including oceanic dolphins vocalise both socially and in echolocation . [ 191 ] [ 192 ] [ 193 ] 

# Feeding 

A short-beaked echidna foraging for insects 

To maintain a high constant body temperature is energy expensive—mammals therefore need a nutritious and plentiful diet. While the earliest mammals were probably predators, different species have since adapted to meet their dietary requirements in a variety of ways. Some eat other animals—this is a carnivorous diet (and includes insectivorous diets). Other mammals, called herbivores , eat plants, which contain complex carbohydrates such as cellulose. An herbivorous diet includes subtypes such as granivory (seed eating), folivory (leaf eating), frugivory (fruit eating), nectarivory (nectar eating), gummivory (gum eating) and mycophagy (fungus eating). The digestive tract of an herbivore is host to bacteria that ferment these complex substances, and make them available for digestion, which are either housed in the multichambered stomach or in a large cecum. [ 93 ] Some mammals are coprophagous , consuming feces to absorb the nutrients not digested when the food was first ingested. [ 89 ] : 131–137 An omnivore eats both prey and plants. Carnivorous mammals have a simple digestive tract because the proteins , lipids and minerals found in meat require little in the way of specialised digestion. Exceptions to this include baleen whales who also house gut flora in a multi-chambered stomach, like terrestrial herbivores. [ 194 ] 

The size of an animal is also a factor in determining diet type ( Allen's rule ). Since small mammals have a high ratio of heat-losing surface area to heat-generating volume, they tend to have high energy requirements and a high metabolic rate . Mammals that weigh less than about 18 ounces (510 g; 1.1 lb) are mostly insectivorous because they cannot tolerate the slow, complex digestive process of an herbivore. Larger animals, on the other hand, generate more heat and less of this heat is lost. They can therefore tolerate either a slower collection process (carnivores that feed on larger vertebrates) or a slower digestive process (herbivores). [ 195 ] Furthermore, mammals that weigh more than 18 ounces (510 g; 1.1 lb) usually cannot collect enough insects during their waking hours to sustain themselves. The only large insectivorous mammals are those that feed on huge colonies of insects ( ants or termites ). [ 196 ] 

The hypocarnivorous American black bear ( Ursus americanus ) vs. the hypercarnivorous polar bear ( Ursus maritimus ) [ 197 ] 

Some mammals are omnivores and display varying degrees of carnivory and herbivory, generally leaning in favour of one more than the other. Since plants and meat are digested differently, there is a preference for one over the other, as in bears where some species may be mostly carnivorous and others mostly herbivorous. [ 198 ] They are grouped into three categories: mesocarnivory (50–70% meat), hypercarnivory (70% and greater of meat), and hypocarnivory (50% or less of meat). The dentition of hypocarnivores consists of dull, triangular carnassial teeth meant for grinding food. Hypercarnivores, however, have conical teeth and sharp carnassials meant for slashing, and in some cases strong jaws for bone-crushing, as in the case of hyenas , allowing them to consume bones; some extinct groups, notably the Machairodontinae , had sabre-shaped canines . [ 197 ] 

Some physiological carnivores consume plant matter and some physiological herbivores consume meat. From a behavioural aspect, this would make them omnivores, but from the physiological standpoint, this may be due to zoopharmacognosy . Physiologically, animals must be able to obtain both energy and nutrients from plant and animal materials to be considered omnivorous. Thus, such animals are still able to be classified as carnivores and herbivores when they are just obtaining nutrients from materials originating from sources that do not seemingly complement their classification. [ 199 ] For example, it is well documented that some ungulates such as giraffes, camels, and cattle, will gnaw on bones to consume particular minerals and nutrients. [ 200 ] Also, cats, which are generally regarded as obligate carnivores, occasionally eat grass to regurgitate indigestible material (such as hairballs ), aid with haemoglobin production, and as a laxative. [ 201 ] 

Many mammals, in the absence of sufficient food requirements in an environment, suppress their metabolism and conserve energy in a process known as hibernation . [ 202 ] In the period preceding hibernation, larger mammals, such as bears, become polyphagic to increase fat stores, whereas smaller mammals prefer to collect and stash food. [ 203 ] The slowing of the metabolism is accompanied by a decreased heart and respiratory rate, as well as a drop in internal temperatures, which can be around ambient temperature in some cases. For example, the internal temperatures of hibernating Arctic ground squirrels can drop to −2.9 °C (26.8 °F); however, the head and neck always stay above 0 °C (32 °F). [ 204 ] A few mammals in hot environments aestivate in times of drought or extreme heat, for example the fat-tailed dwarf lemur ( Cheirogaleus medius ). [ 205 ] 

# Drinking 

This section is an excerpt from Drinking § In other land mammals . [ edit ] 

Cat lapping water in slow motion Jack Russell Terrier laps in water with its tongue. 

By necessity, terrestrial animals in captivity become accustomed to drinking water, but most free-roaming animals stay hydrated through the fluids and moisture in fresh food, [ 206 ] and learn to actively seek foods with high fluid content. [ 207 ] When conditions impel them to drink from bodies of water, the methods and motions differ greatly among species. [ 208 ] 

Cats , canines , and ruminants all lower the neck and lap in water with their powerful tongues. [ 208 ] Cats and canines lap up water with the tongue in a spoon-like shape. [ 209 ] Canines lap water by scooping it into their mouth with a tongue which has taken the shape of a ladle. However, with cats, only the tip of their tongue (which is smooth) touches the water, and then the cat quickly pulls its tongue back into its mouth which soon closes; this results in a column of liquid being pulled into the cat's mouth, which is then secured by its mouth closing. [ 210 ] Ruminants and most other herbivores partially submerge the tip of the mouth in order to draw in water by means of a plunging action with the tongue held straight. [ 211 ] Cats drink at a significantly slower pace than ruminants, who face greater natural predation hazards. [ 208 ] 
Many desert animals do not drink even if water becomes available, but rely on eating succulent plants . [ 208 ] In cold and frozen environments, some animals like hares , tree squirrels , and bighorn sheep resort to consuming snow and icicles. [ 212 ] In savannas , the drinking method of giraffes has been a source of speculation for its apparent defiance of gravity; the most recent theory contemplates the animal's long neck functions like a plunger pump . [ 213 ] Uniquely, elephants draw water into their trunks and squirt it into their mouths. [ 208 ] 

# Intelligence 

See also: Animal cognition 

In intelligent mammals, such as primates , the cerebrum is larger relative to the rest of the brain. Intelligence itself is not easy to define, but indications of intelligence include the ability to learn, matched with behavioural flexibility. Rats , for example, are considered to be highly intelligent, as they can learn and perform new tasks, an ability that may be important when they first colonise a fresh habitat . In some mammals, food gathering appears to be related to intelligence: a deer feeding on plants has a brain smaller than a cat, which must think to outwit its prey. [ 196 ] 
A bonobo fishing for termites with a stick 

Tool use by animals may indicate different levels of learning and cognition . The sea otter uses rocks as essential and regular parts of its foraging behaviour (smashing abalone from rocks or breaking open shells), with some populations spending 21% of their time making tools. [ 214 ] Other tool use, such as chimpanzees using twigs to "fish" for termites, may be developed by watching others use tools and may even be a true example of animal teaching. [ 215 ] Tools may even be used in solving puzzles in which the animal appears to experience a "Eureka moment" . [ 216 ] Other mammals that do not use tools, such as dogs, can also experience a Eureka moment. [ 217 ] 

Brain size was previously considered a major indicator of the intelligence of an animal. Since most of the brain is used for maintaining bodily functions, greater ratios of brain to body mass may increase the amount of brain mass available for more complex cognitive tasks. Allometric analysis indicates that mammalian brain size scales at approximately the 2 ⁄ 3 or 3 ⁄ 4 exponent of the body mass. Comparison of a particular animal's brain size with the expected brain size based on such allometric analysis provides an encephalisation quotient that can be used as another indication of animal intelligence. [ 218 ] Sperm whales have the largest brain mass of any animal on earth, averaging 8,000 cubic centimetres (490 cu in) and 7.8 kilograms (17 lb) in mature males. [ 219 ] 

Self-awareness appears to be a sign of abstract thinking. Self-awareness, although not well-defined, is believed to be a precursor to more advanced processes such as metacognitive reasoning . The traditional method for measuring this is the mirror test , which determines if an animal possesses the ability of self-recognition. [ 220 ] Mammals that have passed the mirror test include Asian elephants (some pass, some do not); [ 221 ] chimpanzees; [ 222 ] bonobos ; [ 223 ] orangutans ; [ 224 ] humans, from 18 months ( mirror stage ); [ 225 ] common bottlenose dolphins ; [ a ] [ 226 ] orcas ; [ 227 ] and false killer whales . [ 227 ] 

# Social structure 

Main article: Social animal 
Female elephants live in stable groups, along with their offspring 

Eusociality is the highest level of social organisation. These societies have an overlap of adult generations, the division of reproductive labour and cooperative caring of young. Usually insects, such as bees , ants and termites, have eusocial behaviour, but it is demonstrated in two rodent species: the naked mole-rat [ 228 ] and the Damaraland mole-rat . [ 229 ] 

Presociality is when animals exhibit more than just sexual interactions with members of the same species, but fall short of qualifying as eusocial. That is, presocial animals can display communal living, cooperative care of young, or primitive division of reproductive labour, but they do not display all of the three essential traits of eusocial animals. Humans and some species of Callitrichidae ( marmosets and tamarins ) are unique among primates in their degree of cooperative care of young. [ 230 ] Harry Harlow set up an experiment with rhesus monkeys , presocial primates, in 1958; the results from this study showed that social encounters are necessary in order for the young monkeys to develop both mentally and sexually. [ 231 ] 

A fission–fusion society is a society that changes frequently in its size and composition, making up a permanent social group called the "parent group". Permanent social networks consist of all individual members of a community and often varies to track changes in their environment. In a fission–fusion society, the main parent group can fracture (fission) into smaller stable subgroups or individuals to adapt to environmental or social circumstances. For example, a number of males may break off from the main group in order to hunt or forage for food during the day, but at night they may return to join (fusion) the primary group to share food and partake in other activities. Many mammals exhibit this, such as primates (for example orangutans and spider monkeys ), [ 232 ] elephants, [ 233 ] spotted hyenas , [ 234 ] lions, [ 235 ] and dolphins. [ 236 ] 

Solitary animals defend a territory and avoid social interactions with the members of its species, except during breeding season. This is to avoid resource competition, as two individuals of the same species would occupy the same niche, and to prevent depletion of food. [ 237 ] A solitary animal, while foraging, can also be less conspicuous to predators or prey. [ 238 ] 
Red kangaroos "boxing" for dominance 

In a hierarchy , individuals are either dominant or submissive. A despotic hierarchy is where one individual is dominant while the others are submissive, as in wolves and lemurs, [ 239 ] and a pecking order is a linear ranking of individuals where there is a top individual and a bottom individual. Pecking orders may also be ranked by sex, where the lowest individual of a sex has a higher ranking than the top individual of the other sex, as in hyenas. [ 240 ] Dominant individuals, or alphas, have a high chance of reproductive success, especially in harems where one or a few males (resident males) have exclusive breeding rights to females in a group. [ 241 ] Non-resident males can also be accepted in harems, but some species, such as the common vampire bat ( Desmodus rotundus ), may be more strict. [ 242 ] 

Some mammals are perfectly monogamous , meaning that they mate for life and take no other partners (even after the original mate's death), as with wolves, Eurasian beavers , and otters. [ 243 ] [ 244 ] There are three types of polygamy: either one or multiple dominant males have breeding rights ( polygyny ), multiple males that females mate with (polyandry), or multiple males have exclusive relations with multiple females ( polygynandry ). It is much more common for polygynous mating to happen, which, excluding leks , are estimated to occur in up to 90% of mammals. [ 245 ] Lek mating occurs when males congregate around females and try to attract them with various courtship displays and vocalisations, as in harbour seals. [ 246 ] 

All higher mammals (excluding monotremes) share two major adaptations for care of the young: live birth and lactation. These imply a group-wide choice of a degree of parental care . They may build nests and dig burrows to raise their young in, or feed and guard them often for a prolonged period of time. Many mammals are K-selected , and invest more time and energy into their young than do r-selected animals. When two animals mate, they both share an interest in the success of the offspring, though often to different extremes. Mammalian females exhibit some degree of maternal aggression, another example of parental care, which may be targeted against other females of the species or the young of other females; however, some mammals may "aunt" the infants of other females, and care for them. Mammalian males may play a role in child rearing, as with tenrecs , however this varies species to species, even within the same genus. For example, the males of the southern pig-tailed macaque ( Macaca nemestrina ) do not participate in child care, whereas the males of the Japanese macaque ( M. fuscata ) do. [ 247 ]

# In human culture 

Upper Paleolithic cave painting of a variety of large mammals, Lascaux , c. 17,300 years old 

Non-human mammals play a wide variety of roles in human culture. They are the most popular of pets , with tens of millions of dogs, cats and other animals including rabbits and mice kept by families around the world. [ 248 ] [ 249 ] [ 250 ] Mammals such as mammoths , horses and deer are among the earliest subjects of art, being found in Upper Paleolithic cave paintings such as at Lascaux . [ 251 ] Major artists such as Albrecht Dürer , George Stubbs and Edwin Landseer are known for their portraits of mammals. [ 252 ] Many species of mammals have been hunted for sport and for food; deer and wild boar are especially popular as game animals . [ 253 ] [ 254 ] [ 255 ] Mammals such as horses and dogs are widely raced for sport, often combined with betting on the outcome . [ 256 ] [ 257 ] There is a tension between the role of animals as companions to humans, and their existence as individuals with rights of their own . [ 258 ] Mammals further play a wide variety of roles in literature, [ 259 ] [ 260 ] [ 261 ] film, [ 262 ] mythology, and religion. [ 263 ] [ 264 ] [ 265 ] 

# Uses and importance 

See also: Livestock , Laboratory animal , and Pack animal 
Cattle have been kept for milk for thousands of years. 

The domestication of mammals was instrumental in the Neolithic development of agriculture and of civilisation , causing farmers to replace hunter-gatherers around the world. [ b ] [ 267 ] This transition from hunting and gathering to herding flocks and growing crops was a major step in human history. The new agricultural economies, based on domesticated mammals, caused "radical restructuring of human societies, worldwide alterations in biodiversity, and significant changes in the Earth's landforms and its atmosphere... momentous outcomes". [ 268 ] 

Domestic mammals form a large part of the livestock raised for meat across the world. They include (2009) around 1.4 billion cattle , 1 billion sheep , 1 billion domestic pigs , [ 269 ] [ 270 ] and (1985) over 700 million rabbits. [ 271 ] Working domestic animals including cattle and horses have been used for work and transport from the origins of agriculture, their numbers declining with the arrival of mechanised transport and agricultural machinery . In 2004 they still provided some 80% of the power for the mainly small farms in the third world, and some 20% of the world's transport, again mainly in rural areas. In mountainous regions unsuitable for wheeled vehicles, pack animals continue to transport goods. [ 272 ] Mammal skins provide leather for shoes , clothing and upholstery . Wool from mammals including sheep, goats and alpacas has been used for centuries for clothing. [ 273 ] [ 274 ] 
Livestock make up 62% of the world's mammal biomass; humans account for 34%; and wild mammals are just 4% [ 275 ] 

Mammals serve a major role in science as experimental animals , both in fundamental biological research, such as in genetics, [ 276 ] and in the development of new medicines, which must be tested exhaustively to demonstrate their safety . [ 277 ] Millions of mammals, especially mice and rats, are used in experiments each year. [ 278 ] A knockout mouse is a genetically modified mouse with an inactivated gene , replaced or disrupted with an artificial piece of DNA. They enable the study of sequenced genes whose functions are unknown. [ 279 ] A small percentage of the mammals are non-human primates, used in research for their similarity to humans. [ 280 ] [ 281 ] [ 282 ] 

Despite the benefits domesticated mammals had for human development, humans have an increasingly detrimental effect on wild mammals across the world. It has been estimated that the mass of all wild mammals has declined to only 4% of all mammals, with 96% of mammals being humans and their livestock now (see figure). In fact, terrestrial wild mammals make up only 2% of all mammals. [ 283 ] [ 284 ] 

# Hybrids 

Main article: Hybrid (biology)

A true quagga , 1870 (left) vs. a bred-back quagga , 2014 (right) 

Hybrids are offspring resulting from the breeding of two genetically distinct individuals, which usually will result in a high degree of heterozygosity, though hybrid and heterozygous are not synonymous. The deliberate or accidental hybridising of two or more species of closely related animals through captive breeding is a human activity which has been in existence for millennia and has grown for economic purposes. [ 285 ] Hybrids between different subspecies within a species (such as between the Bengal tiger and Siberian tiger ) are known as intra-specific hybrids. Hybrids between different species within the same genus (such as between lions and tigers) are known as interspecific hybrids or crosses. Hybrids between different genera (such as between sheep and goats) are known as intergeneric hybrids. [ 286 ] Natural hybrids will occur in hybrid zones , where two populations of species within the same genera or species living in the same or adjacent areas will interbreed with each other. Some hybrids have been recognised as species, such as the red wolf (though this is controversial). [ 287 ] 

Artificial selection , the deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals, is being used to breed back recently extinct animals in an attempt to achieve an animal breed with a phenotype that resembles that extinct wildtype ancestor. A breeding-back (intraspecific) hybrid may be very similar to the extinct wildtype in appearance, ecological niche and to some extent genetics, but the initial gene pool of that wild type is lost forever with its extinction . As a result, bred-back breeds are at best vague look-alikes of extinct wildtypes, as Heck cattle are of the aurochs . [ 288 ] 

Purebred wild species evolved to a specific ecology can be threatened with extinction [ 289 ] through the process of genetic pollution , the uncontrolled hybridisation, introgression genetic swamping which leads to homogenisation or out-competition from the heterosic hybrid species. [ 290 ] When new populations are imported or selectively bred by people, or when habitat modification brings previously isolated species into contact, extinction in some species, especially rare varieties, is possible. [ 291 ] Interbreeding can swamp the rarer gene pool and create hybrids, depleting the purebred gene pool. For example, the endangered wild water buffalo is most threatened with extinction by genetic pollution from the domestic water buffalo . Such extinctions are not always apparent from a morphological standpoint. Some degree of gene flow is a normal evolutionary process, nevertheless, hybridisation threatens the existence of rare species. [ 292 ] [ 293 ] 

# Threats

Biodiversity of large mammal species per continent before and after humans arrived there 

The loss of species from ecological communities, defaunation , is primarily driven by human activity. [ 294 ] This has resulted in empty forests , ecological communities depleted of large vertebrates. [ 295 ] [ 296 ] In the Quaternary extinction event , the mass die-off of megafaunal variety coincided with the appearance of humans, suggesting a human influence. One hypothesis is that humans hunted large mammals, such as the woolly mammoth , into extinction. [ 297 ] [ 298 ] The 2019 Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services by IPBES states that the total biomass of wild mammals has declined by 82 per cent since the beginning of human civilisation. [ 299 ] [ 300 ] Wild animals make up just 4% of mammalian biomass on earth, while humans and their domesticated animals make up 96%. [ 284 ] 

Various species are predicted to become extinct in the near future , [ 301 ] among them the rhinoceros , [ 302 ] giraffes , [ 303 ] and species of primates [ 304 ] and pangolins . [ 305 ] According to the WWF's 2020 Living Planet Report , vertebrate wildlife populations have declined by 68% since 1970 as a result of human activities, particularly overconsumption , population growth and intensive farming , which is evidence that humans have triggered a sixth mass extinction event. [ 306 ] [ 307 ] Hunting alone threatens hundreds of mammalian species around the world. [ 308 ] [ 309 ] Scientists claim that the growing demand for meat is contributing to biodiversity loss as this is a significant driver of deforestation and habitat destruction ; species-rich habitats, such as significant portions of the Amazon rainforest , are being converted to agricultural land for meat production. [ 310 ] [ 311 ] [ 312 ] Another influence is over-hunting and poaching , which can reduce the overall population of game animals, [ 313 ] especially those located near villages, [ 314 ] as in the case of peccaries . [ 315 ] The effects of poaching can especially be seen in the ivory trade with African elephants. [ 316 ] Marine mammals are at risk from entanglement from fishing gear, notably cetaceans , with discard mortalities ranging from 65,000 to 86,000 individuals annually. [ 317 ] 

Attention is being given to endangered species globally, notably through the Convention on Biological Diversity , otherwise known as the Rio Accord, which includes 189 signatory countries that are focused on identifying endangered species and habitats. [ 318 ] Another notable conservation organisation is the IUCN, which has a membership of over 1,200 governmental and non-governmental organisations. [ 319 ] 

Recent extinctions can be directly attributed to human influences. [ 320 ] [ 294 ] The IUCN characterises 'recent' extinction as those that have occurred past the cut-off point of 1500, [ 321 ] and around 80 mammal species have gone extinct since that time and 2015. [ 322 ] Some species, such as the Père David's deer [ 323 ] are extinct in the wild , and survive solely in captive populations. Other species, such as the Florida panther , are ecologically extinct , surviving in such low numbers that they essentially have no impact on the ecosystem. [ 324 ] : 318 Other populations are only locally extinct (extirpated), still existing elsewhere, but reduced in distribution, [ 324 ] : 75–77 as with the extinction of grey whales in the Atlantic . [ 325 ]

Carnivora ( / k ɑːr ˈ n ɪ v ər ə / kar- NIH -vər-ə ) is an order of placental mammals specialized primarily in eating flesh, whose members are formally referred to as carnivorans . The order Carnivora is the sixth largest order of mammals, [ 22 ] comprising at least 279 species . Carnivorans are found on every major landmass and in a variety of habitats, ranging from the cold polar regions of Earth to the hyper-arid region of the Sahara Desert and the open seas. Carnivorans exhibit a wide array of body plans, varying greatly in size and shape. 

Carnivora are divided into two suborders , the Feliformia , containing the true felids and several " cat -like" animals; and the Caniformia , containing the true canids and many " dog -like" animals. The feliforms include the Felidae , Viverridae , hyena , and mongoose families, the majority of which live only in the Old World; cats are the only exception, occurring in the Old World and the New World, entering the Americas via the Bering land bridge . The caniforms include the Caninae , Procyonidae , bears , mustelids , skunks , and pinnipeds that occur worldwide with immense diversity in their morphology, diet, and behavior. 

# Etymology 
[ edit ] 

The word Carnivora is derived from Latin carō (stem carn- ) 'flesh' and vorāre 'to devour'. [ 23 ] 

# Phylogeny 
[ edit ] 

The oldest known carnivoran line mammals ( Carnivoramorpha ) appeared in North America 6 million years after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event . [ 24 ] [ 25 ] These early ancestors of carnivorans would have resembled small weasel or genet -like mammals, occupying a nocturnal shift on the forest floor or in the trees, as other groups of mammals like the mesonychians and later the creodonts were occupying the megafaunal faunivorous niche. However, following the extinction of mesonychians and the oxyaenid creodonts at the end of the Eocene, carnivorans quickly moved into this niche, with forms like the nimravids being the dominant large-bodied ambush predators during the Oligocene alongside the hyaenodont creodonts (which similarly produced larger, more open-country forms at the start of the Oligocene). By the time Miocene epoch appeared, most if not all of the major lineages and families of carnivorans had diversified and become the most dominant group of large terrestrial predators in Eurasia and North America, with various lineages being successful in megafaunal faunivorous niches at different intervals during the Miocene and later epochs. 

# Systematics 
[ edit ] 

# Evolution 
[ edit ] 
Life reconstruction of Tapocyon robustus , a species of miacid 

The order Carnivora belongs to a group of mammals known as Laurasiatheria , which also includes other groups such as bats and ungulates . [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Within this group the carnivorans are placed in the clade Ferae . Ferae includes the closest extant relative of carnivorans, the pangolins , as well as several extinct groups of mostly Paleogene carnivorous placentals such as the creodonts , the arctocyonians , and mesonychians . [ 28 ] The creodonts were originally thought of as the sister taxon to the carnivorans, perhaps even ancestral to, based on the presence of the carnassial teeth , [ 29 ] but the nature of the carnassial teeth is different between the two groups. In carnivorans, the carnassials are positioned near the front of the molar row, while in the creodonts, they are positioned near the back of the molar row, [ 30 ] and this suggests a separate evolutionary history and an order-level distinction. [ 31 ] In addition, phylogenetic analysis suggests that creodonts are more closely related to pangolins while mesonychians might be the sister group to carnivorans and their stem-relatives. [ 28 ] 

The closest stem-carnivorans are the miacoids . The miacoids include the families Viverravidae and Miacidae , and together the Carnivora and Miacoidea form the stem-clade Carnivoramorpha . The miacoids were small, genet-like carnivoramorphs that occupy a variety of niches such as terrestrial and arboreal habitats. Studies have shown that while viverravids are a monophyletic basal group, the miacids are paraphyletic with respect to Carnivora (as shown in the phylogeny below). [ 32 ] [ 33 ] 

Carnivoramorpha as a whole first appeared in the Paleocene of North America about 60 million years ago. [ 25 ] Crown carnivorans first appeared around 42 million years ago in the Middle Eocene . [ 34 ] Their molecular phylogeny shows the extant Carnivora are a monophyletic group, the crown group of the Carnivoramorpha . [ 35 ] From there carnivorans have split into two clades based on the composition of the bony structures that surround the middle ear of the skull, the cat-like feliforms and the dog-like caniforms . [ 36 ] In feliforms, the auditory bullae are double-chambered, composed of two bones joined by a septum . Caniforms have single-chambered or partially divided auditory bullae, composed of a single bone. [ 37 ] Initially, the early representatives of carnivorans were small as the creodonts (specifically, the oxyaenids) and mesonychians dominated the apex predator niches during the Eocene, but in the Oligocene, carnivorans became a dominant group of apex predators with the nimravids , and by the Miocene most of the extant carnivoran families have diversified and become the primary terrestrial predators in the Northern Hemisphere. 

# Classification of the extant carnivorans 
[ edit ] 

See also: List of carnivorans 

In 1758, the Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus placed all carnivorans known at the time into the group Ferae (not to be confused with the modern concept of Ferae which also includes pangolins) in the tenth edition of his book Systema Naturae . He recognized six genera: Canis (canids and hyaenids), Phoca (pinnipeds), Felis (felids), Viverra (viverrids, herpestids, and mephitids), Mustela (non-badger mustelids), and Ursus (ursids, large species of mustelids, and procyonids). [ 19 ] It was not until 1821 that the English writer and traveler Thomas Edward Bowdich gave the group its modern and accepted name. [ 2 ] 

Initially, the modern concept of Carnivora was divided into two suborders: the terrestrial Fissipedia and the marine Pinnipedia . [ 38 ] Below is the classification of how the extant families were related to each other after American paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson in 1945: [ 38 ] 

- Order Carnivora Bowdich, 1821 
- Suborder Fissipedia Blumenbach, 1791 
- Superfamily Canoidea G. Fischer de Waldheim, 1817 
- Family Canidae G. Fischer de Waldheim, 1817 – dogs 
- Family Ursidae G. Fischer de Waldheim, 1817 – bears 
- Family Procyonidae Bonaparte, 1850 – raccoons, ringtails and coatis (also included red pandas as subfamily Ailurinae , which is now treated as a family) 
- Family Mustelidae G. Fischer de Waldheim, 1817 – badgers, otters, weasels and skunks (as subfamily Mephitinae , now treated as family) 
- Superfamily Feloidea G. Fischer de Waldheim, 1817 
- Family Viverridae J. E. Gray, 1821 – civets and allies, including mongooses (now family Herpestidae ), African palm civets (now family Nandiniidae ) and  Asiatic linsangs (now family Prionodontidae ) 
- Family Hyaenidae J. E. Gray, 1821 – hyenas 
- Family Felidae G. Fischer de Waldheim, 1817 – cats 
- Suborder Pinnipedia Iliger, 1811 
- Family Otariidae J. E. Gray, 1825 – eared seals 
- Family Odobenidae J. A. Allen, 1880 – walruses 
- Family Phocidae J. E. Gray, 1821 – earless seals 

Since then, however, the methods in which mammalogists use to assess the phylogenetic relationships among the carnivoran families has been improved with using more complicated and intensive incorporation of genetics, morphology and the fossil record. Research into Carnivora phylogeny since 1945 has found Fissipedia to be paraphyletic in respect to Pinnipedia, [ 39 ] with pinnipeds being either more closely related to bears or to weasels. [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ] The small carnivoran families Viverridae, [ 45 ] Procyonidae, and Mustelidae have been found to be polyphyletic : 

- Mongooses and a handful of Malagasy endemic species are found to be in a clade with hyenas, with the Malagasy species being in their own family Eupleridae . [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] 
- The African palm civet is a basal cat-like carnivoran. [ 49 ] 
- The linsang is more closely related to cats. [ 50 ] 
- Pandas are not procyonids nor are they a natural grouping. [ 51 ] The giant panda is a true bear [ 52 ] [ 53 ] while the red panda is a distinct family. [ 54 ] 
- Skunks and stink badgers are placed in their own family, and are the sister group to a clade containing Ailuridae, Procyonidae and Mustelidae sensu stricto . [ 55 ] [ 54 ] 

Below is a table chart of the extant carnivoran families and number of extant species recognized by various authors of the first (2009 [ 56 ] ) and fourth (2014 [ 57 ] ) volumes of the Handbook of the Mammals of the World :

# Anatomy 
[ edit ] 

# Skull 
[ edit ] 
Skull of a fossa ( Cryptoprocta ferox ). Note the large and conical canine and carnassial teeth common in feliforms . 

The canine teeth are usually large, conical, thick and stress resistant. All of the terrestrial species of carnivorans have three incisors on each side of each jaw (the exception is the sea otter ( Enhydra lutris ) which only has two lower incisor teeth). [ 58 ] The third molar has been lost. The carnassial pair is made up of the fourth upper premolar and the first lower molar teeth. Like most mammals, the dentition is heterodont , though in some species, such as the aardwolf ( Proteles cristata ), the teeth have been greatly reduced and the cheek teeth are specialised for eating insects. In pinnipeds, the teeth are homodont as they have evolved to grasp or catch fish, and the cheek teeth are often lost. [ 59 ] In bears and raccoons, the carnassial pair is secondarily reduced. [ 59 ] The skulls are heavily built with a strong zygomatic arch . Often a sagittal crest is present, sometimes more evident in sexually dimorphic species such as sea lions and fur seals , though it has also been greatly reduced in some small carnivorans. [ 59 ] The braincase is enlarged with the frontoparietal bone at the front. In most species, the eyes are at the front of the face. In caniforms, the rostrum is usually long with many teeth, while in feliforms it is shorter with fewer teeth. The carnassial teeth of feliforms are generally more sectional than those of caniforms. 

The turbinates are large and complex in comparison to other mammals, providing a large surface area for olfactory receptors . [ 59 ] 

# Postcranial region 
[ edit ] 
A black-backed jackal ( Lupulella mesomelas ) trying to predate on a brown fur seal ( Arctocephalus pusillus ) pup. These two species illustrate the diversity in bodyplan seen among carnivorans, especially between pinnipeds and their terrestrial relatives. 

Aside from an accumulation of characteristics in the dental and cranial features, not much of their overall anatomy unites carnivorans as a group. [ 58 ] All species of carnivorans are quadrupedal and most have five digits on the front feet and four digits on the back feet. In terrestrial carnivorans, the feet have soft pads. The feet can either be digitigrade as seen in cats, hyenas, and dogs or plantigrade as seen in bears, skunks, raccoons, weasels, civets, and mongooses. In pinnipeds, the limbs have been modified into flippers . 
Members of the Carnivora order, like this tiger , have pads on their feet. 

Unlike cetaceans and sirenians , which have fully functional tails to help them swim, pinnipeds use their limbs underwater to swim. Earless seals use their back flippers; sea lions and fur seals use their front flippers, and the walrus uses all of its limbs. As a result, pinnipeds have significantly shorter tails than other carnivorans. 

Aside from the pinnipeds, dogs, bears, hyenas, and cats all have distinct and recognizable appearances. Dogs are usually cursorial mammals and are gracile in appearance, often relying on their teeth to hold prey; bears are much larger and rely on their physical strength to forage for food. Compared to dogs and bears, cats have longer and stronger forelimbs armed with retractable claws to hold on to prey. Hyenas are dog-like feliforms that have sloping backs due to their front legs being longer than their hind legs. The raccoon family and red panda are small, bear-like carnivorans with long tails. The other small carnivoran families Nandiniidae , Prionodontidae , Viverridae , Herpestidae , Eupleridae , Mephitidae , and Mustelidae have through convergent evolution maintained the small, ancestral appearance of the miacoids, though there is some variation seen such as the robust and stout physicality of badgers and the wolverine ( Gulo gulo ). [ 58 ] 

Most carnivoran species have a well-defined breeding season . [ 60 ] Male carnivorans will usually have bacula , which are absent in hyenas and binturongs . [ 61 ] 

The length and density of the fur can vary depending on the environment that the species inhabits. In warm climate species, the fur is often short in length and lighter. In cold climate species, the fur is can be either dense or long, often with an oily substance that helps to retain heat. The pelage coloration differs between species, often including black, white, orange, yellow, red, and many shades of grey and brown. Some are striped, spotted, blotched, banded, or otherwise boldly patterned. There may be a correlation between habitat and color pattern; for example, spotted or banded species tend to be found in heavily forested environments. [ 58 ] Some species like the grey wolf are polymorphic with different individual having different coat colors. The arctic fox ( Vulpes lagopus ) and the stoat ( Mustela erminea ) have fur that changes from white and dense in the winter to brown and sparse in the summer. In pinnipeds and polar bears , a thick insulating layer of blubber helps maintain their body temperature. 

# Sexual dimorphism

This section is an excerpt from Sexual dimorphism in Carnivorans . [ edit ]

Sexual dimorphism in pinnipeds , particularly elephant seals , is the most pronounced among Carnivorans. Sexual dimorphism in lions is the most prominent among felids Sexual dimorphism is the condition where sexes of the same species exhibit different morphological characteristics , particularly characteristics not directly involved in reproduction . [ 62 ] Sexual dimorphism in carnivorans, in which males are larger than females, is common. Sexual selection is frequently cited as the cause of the intraspecific divergence in body proportions and craniomandibular morphology between the sexes within the Carnivora order. [ 63 ] [ 64 ] It is anticipated that animals with polygynous mating systems and high levels of territoriality and solitary behavior will exhibit the highest levels of sexual size dimorphism. Pinnipeds offer an illustration for this. 

# Relationship with humans 
[ edit ] 

Carnivorans are arguably the group of mammals of most interest to humans. The dog is noteworthy for not only being the first species of carnivoran to be domesticated , but also the first species of any taxon. In the last 10,000 to 12,000 years, humans have selectively bred dogs for a variety of different tasks and today there are well over 400 breeds. The cat is another domesticated carnivoran. Many other species are popular, and they are often charismatic megafauna . Many civilizations have incorporated a species of carnivoran into their culture: a prominent example is the lion , viewed as a symbol of power and royalty in many societies. Yet many species such as wolves and the big cats have been broadly hunted, resulting in extirpation in some areas. Habitat loss and human encroachment as well as climate change have been the primary cause of many species going into decline. Four species of carnivorans have gone extinct since the 1600s: Falkland Island wolf ( Dusicyon australis ) in 1876; the sea mink ( Neogale macrodon ) in 1894; the Japanese sea lion ( Zalophus japonicus ) in 1951 and the Caribbean monk seal ( Neomonachus tropicalis ) in 1952. [ 24 ] Some species such as the red fox ( Vulpes vulpes ) and stoat ( Mustela erminea ) have been introduced to Australasia and have caused many native species to become endangered or even extinct.

Species 

See § Taxonomy 
Native Felis range 

Felis is a genus of small and medium-sized cat species native to most of Africa and south of 60° latitude in Europe and Asia to Indochina . The genus includes the domestic cat . The smallest of the seven Felis species is the black-footed cat with a head and body length from 38 to 42 cm (15 to 17 in). The largest is the jungle cat with a head and body length from 62 to 76 cm (24 to 30 in). [ 1 ] 

Genetic studies indicate that the Felinae genera Felis , Otocolobus and Prionailurus diverged from a Eurasian progenitor of the Felidae about 6.2 million years ago , and that Felis species split off 3.04 to 0.99 million years ago. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] 

# Etymology 
[ edit ] 

The generic name Felis is derived from Classical Latin fēlis meaning 'cat, ferret'. [ 4 ] 

# Taxonomy 
[ edit ] 

Carl Linnaeus considered Felis to comprise all cat species known until 1758. [ 5 ] Later taxonomists split the cat family into different genera. In 1917, the British zoologist Reginald Innes Pocock revised the genus Felis as comprising only the ones listed in the following table. [ 1 ] Estimated genetic divergence times of the listed species are indicated in million years ago (Mya), based on analysis of autosomal , xDNA, yDNA and mtDNA gene segments. [ 2 ]

Pocock accepted the Pallas's cat as the only member of the genus Otocolobus . [ 1 ] Other scientists consider it also a Felis species. [ 19 ] 

Several scientists consider the Chinese mountain cat a subspecies of F. silvestris . [ 20 ]

# Extinct Felis species 
[ edit ] 

Extinct Felis species in the fossil record include: 

- Felis lunensis ( Martelli , 1906) [ 21 ] 
- Felis wenzensis (Stach, 1961) [ 22 ] 

# Characteristics 
[ edit ] 

Felis species have high and wide skulls, short jaws and narrow ears with short tufts, but without any white spots on the back of the ears. Their pupils contract to a vertical slit. [ 1 ] A black cat from Transcaucasia described in 1904 as F. daemon by Satunin [ 23 ] turned out to be a feral cat , probably a hybrid of wildcat and domestic cat. [ 24 ] The Kellas cat is a hybrid between domestic cat and European wildcat occurring in Scotland . [ 25 ] 

The Corsican wildcat is considered to have been introduced to Corsica before the beginning of the 1st millennium. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] A genetic study of a dozen individuals showed that they are closely related to the African wildcat originating in the Middle East. [ 28 ]

Species naming system 

"Latin name" redirects here. For personal names in the Roman Empire, see Roman naming conventions . For the practice of rendering names in a Latin style, see Latinisation of names . 

Orcinus orca , the orca or the killer  whale Echinopsis pachanoi , the San Pedro cactus 

In taxonomy , binomial nomenclature ("two-term naming system"), also called binary nomenclature , is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms , although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (often shortened to just "binomial"), a binomen , [ 1 ] binominal name , or a scientific name ; more informally, it is also called a Latin name . In the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), the system is also called binominal nomenclature , [ 2 ] with an "n" before the "al" in "binominal", which is not a typographic error, meaning "two-name naming system". [ 1 ] 

The first part of the name – the generic name – identifies the genus to which the species belongs, whereas the second part – the specific name or specific epithet – distinguishes the species within the genus. For example, modern humans belong to the genus Homo and within this genus to the species Homo sapiens . Tyrannosaurus rex is likely the most widely known binomial. [ 3 ] The formal introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus , effectively beginning with his work Species Plantarum in 1753. [ 4 ] But as early as 1622, Gaspard Bauhin introduced in his book Pinax theatri botanici (English, Illustrated exposition of plants ) containing many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. [ 5 ] Binomial nomenclature was introduced in order to provide succinct, relatively stable and verifiable names that could be used and understood internationally, unlike common names which are usually different in every language. [ 6 ] 

The application of binomial nomenclature is now governed by various internationally agreed codes of rules, of which the two most important are the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ( ICZN ) for animals and the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants ( ICNafp or ICN ). Although the general principles underlying binomial nomenclature are common to these two codes, there are some differences in the terminology they use and their particular rules. 

In modern usage, the first letter of the generic name is always capitalized in writing, while that of the specific epithet is not, even when derived from a proper noun such as the name of a person or place. Similarly, both parts are italicized in normal text (or underlined in handwriting). Thus the binomial name of the annual phlox (named after botanist Thomas Drummond ) is now written as Phlox drummondii . Often, after a species name is introduced in a text, the generic name is abbreviated to the first letter in subsequent mentions (e.g., P. drummondii ). 

In scientific works, the authority for a binomial name is usually given, at least when it is first mentioned, and the year of publication may be specified. 

- In zoology 
- " Patella vulgata Linnaeus, 1758". The name "Linnaeus" tells the reader who published the name, and description for this species; 1758 is the year the name and original description were published (in this case, in the 10th edition of the book Systema Naturae ). 
- " Passer domesticus (Linnaeus, 1758)". The original name given by Linnaeus was Fringilla domestica ; the parentheses indicate that the species is now placed in a different genus. The ICZN does not require that the name of the person who changed the genus be given, nor the date on which the change was made, although nomenclatorial catalogs usually include such information. 
- In botany 
- " Amaranthus retroflexus L." – "L." is the standard abbreviation used for "Linnaeus". 
- " Hyacinthoides italica (L.) Rothm." – Linnaeus first named this bluebell species Scilla italica ; Rothmaler transferred it to the genus Hyacinthoides ; the ICNafp does not require that the dates of either publication be specified. 

# Etymology 
[ edit ] 

The word binomial is composed of two elements: bi- ( Latin prefix meaning 'two') and nomial (the adjective form of nomen , Latin for 'name'). In Medieval Latin, the related word binomium was used to signify one term in a binomial expression in mathematics. [ 7 ] In fact, the Latin word binomium may validly refer to either of the epithets in the binomial name, which can equally be referred to as a binomen (pl. binomina ). [ 8 ] 

# History 
[ edit ] 
Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778), a Swedish botanist, physician, and zoologist, invented the modern system of binomial nomenclature 

Before the adoption of the modern binomial system of naming species, a scientific name consisted of a generic name combined with a specific name that was from one to several words long. Together they formed a system of polynomial nomenclature. [ 9 ] These names had two separate functions: to designate or label the species, and to be a diagnosis or description. These two goals were eventually found to be incompatible. [ 10 ] In a simple genus that contained few species, it was easy to tell them apart with a one-word genus and a one-word specific name; but as more species were discovered, the names necessarily became longer and unwieldy—for instance, Plantago foliis ovato-lanceolatus pubescentibus, spica cylindrica, scapo tereti ("plantain with pubescent ovate-lanceolate leaves, a cylindric spike and a terete scape "), which we know today as Plantago media . [ 11 ] 

Such "polynomial names" may sometimes look like binomials, but are different. For example, Gerard's herbal (as amended by Johnson) describes various kinds of spiderwort: "The first is called Phalangium ramosum , Branched Spiderwort; the second, Phalangium non ramosum , Unbranched Spiderwort. The other ... is aptly termed Phalangium Ephemerum Virginianum , Soon-Fading Spiderwort of Virginia". [ 12 ] The Latin phrases are short descriptions, rather than identifying labels. 

The Bauhins , in particular Caspar Bauhin (1560–1624), took some important steps towards the binomial system by pruning the Latin descriptions, in many cases to two words. [ 13 ] The adoption by biologists of a system of strictly binomial nomenclature is due to Swedish botanist and physician Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778). It was in his 1753 Species Plantarum that Linnaeus began consistently using a one-word trivial name ( nomen triviale ) after a generic name (genus name) in a system of binomial nomenclature. [ 14 ] Trivial names had already appeared in his Critica Botanica (1737) and Philosophia Botanica (1751). This trivial name is what is now known as a specific epithet ( ICNafp ) or specific name ( ICZN ). [ 14 ] The Bauhins' genus names were retained in many of these, but the descriptive part was reduced to a single word. 

Linnaeus's trivial names introduced the idea that the function of a name could simply be to give a species a unique label, meaning that the name no longer needed to be descriptive. Both parts could, for example, be derived from the names of people. Thus Gerard's Phalangium ephemerum virginianum became Tradescantia virginiana , where the genus name honoured John Tradescant the Younger , [ note 1 ] an English botanist and gardener. [ 15 ] A bird in the parrot family was named Psittacus alexandri , meaning "Alexander's parrot", after Alexander the Great , whose armies introduced eastern parakeets to Greece. [ 16 ] Linnaeus's trivial names were much easier to remember and use than the parallel polynomial names, and eventually replaced them. [ 4 ] 

# Value 
[ edit ] 
The bacterium Escherichia coli , commonly shortened to E. coli 

The value of the binomial nomenclature system derives primarily from its economy, its widespread use, and the uniqueness and stability of names that the Codes of Zoological and Botanical , Bacterial and Viral Nomenclature provide: 

- Economy. Compared to the polynomial system which it replaced, a binomial name is shorter and easier to remember. [ 4 ] It corresponds to the noun-adjective form many vernacular names take to indicate a species within a group (for example, 'brown bear' to refer to a particular type of bear), [ 6 ] as well as the widespread system of family name plus given name (s) used to name people in many cultures. [ 13 ] 
- Widespread use. The binomial system of nomenclature is governed by international codes and is used by biologists worldwide. [ 17 ] A few binomials have also entered common speech, such as Homo sapiens , E. coli , Boa constrictor , Tyrannosaurus rex , and Aloe vera . 
- Uniqueness. Provided that taxonomists agree as to the limits of a species, it can have only one name that is correct under the appropriate nomenclature code , generally the earliest published if two or more names are accidentally assigned to a species. [ 18 ] This means the species a binomial name refers to can be clearly identified, as compared to the common names of species which are usually different in every language. [ 6 ] However, establishing that two names actually refer to the same species and then determining which has priority can sometimes be difficult, particularly if the species was named by biologists from different countries. Therefore, a species may have more than one regularly used name; all but one of these names are " synonyms ". [ 19 ] Furthermore, within zoology or botany, each species name applies to only one species. If a name is used more than once, it is called a homonym . Erithacus rubecula superbus , the Tenerife robin or petirrojo 
- Stability. Although stability is far from absolute, the procedures associated with establishing binomial names, such as the principle of priority , tend to favor stability. [ 20 ] For example, when species are transferred between genera (as not uncommonly happens as a result of new knowledge), the second part of the binomial is kept the same (unless it becomes a homonym). Thus, there is disagreement among botanists as to whether the genera Chionodoxa and Scilla are sufficiently different for them to be kept separate. Those who keep them separate give the plant commonly grown in gardens in Europe the name Chionodoxa siehei ; those who do not give it the name Scilla siehei . [ 21 ] The siehei element is constant. Similarly, if what were previously thought to be two distinct species are demoted to a lower rank, such as subspecies, the second part of the binomial name is retained as a trinomen (the third part of the new name). Thus, the Tenerife robin may be treated as a different species from the European robin, in which case its name is Erithacus superbus , or as only a subspecies, in which case its name is Erithacus rubecula superbus . [ 22 ] The superbus element of the name is constant, as are its authorship and year of publication. 

# Problems 
[ edit ] 

Binomial nomenclature for species has the effect that when a species is moved from one genus to another, sometimes the specific name or epithet must be changed as well. This may happen because the specific name is already used in the new genus, or to agree in gender with the new genus if the specific epithet is an adjective modifying the genus name. Some biologists have argued for the combination of the genus name and specific epithet into a single unambiguous name, or for the use of uninomials (as used in nomenclature of ranks above species). [ 23 ] [ 24 ] 

Because genus names are unique only within a nomenclature code, it is possible for homonyms (two or more species sharing the same genus name) to happen, and even the same binomial if they occur in different kingdoms. At least 1,258 instances of genus name duplication occur (mainly between zoology and botany). [ 25 ] [ 26 ] 

# Relationship to classification and taxonomy 
[ edit ] 

Nomenclature (including binomial nomenclature) is not the same as classification, although the two are related. Classification is the ordering of items into groups based on similarities or differences; in biological classification , species are one of the kinds of item to be classified. [ 27 ] In principle, the names given to species could be completely independent of their classification. This is not the case for binomial names, since the first part of a binomial is the name of the genus into which the species is placed. Above the rank of genus, binomial nomenclature and classification are partly independent; for example, a species retains its binomial name if it is moved from one family to another or from one order to another, unless it better fits a different genus in the same or different family, or it is split from its old genus and placed in a newly created genus. The independence is only partial since the names of families and other higher taxa are usually based on genera. 

Taxonomy includes both nomenclature and classification. Its first stages (sometimes called " alpha taxonomy ") are concerned with finding, describing and naming species of living or fossil organisms. [ 28 ] Binomial nomenclature is thus an important part of taxonomy as it is the system by which species are named. Taxonomists are also concerned with classification, including its principles, procedures and rules. [ 29 ] 

# Derivation of binomial names 
[ edit ] 

See also: List of Latin and Greek words commonly used in systematic names 

A complete binomial name is always treated grammatically as if it were a phrase in the Latin language (hence the common use of the term "Latin name" for a binomial name). However, the two parts of a binomial name can each be derived from a number of sources, of which Latin is only one. These include: 

- Latin, from any period, whether classical , medieval or modern . Thus, both parts of the binomial name Homo sapiens are Latin words, meaning "wise" ( sapiens ) "human/man" ( Homo ). 
- Classical Greek . The genus Rhododendron was named by Linnaeus from the Greek word ῥοδόδενδρον , itself derived from rhodon , "rose", and dendron , "tree". [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Greek words are often converted to a Latinized form. Thus coca (the plant from which cocaine is obtained) has the name Erythroxylum coca . Erythroxylum is derived from the Greek words erythros , red, and xylon , wood. [ 32 ] The Greek ending - ον (-on), when it is neuter, is often converted to the Latin neuter ending -um . [ note 2 ] 
- Other languages. The second part of the name Erythroxylum coca is derived from kuka , the name of the plant in Aymara and Quechua . [ 33 ] [ 34 ] Since many dinosaur fossils were found in Mongolia, their names often use Mongolian words, e.g. Tarchia from tarkhi , meaning "brain", or Saichania meaning "beautiful one". 
- Names of people (often naturalists or biologists). The name Magnolia campbellii commemorates two people: Pierre Magnol , a French botanist, and Archibald Campbell , a doctor in British India . [ 35 ] 
- Names of places. The lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum , is widespread in the United States. [ 36 ] 
- Other sources. Some binomial names have been constructed from taxonomic anagrams or other re-orderings of existing names. Thus the name of the genus Muilla is derived by reversing the name Allium . [ 37 ] Names may also be derived from jokes or puns . For example, Neal Evenhuis described a number of species of flies in a genus he named Pieza , including Pieza pi , Pieza rhea , Pieza kake , and Pieza deresistans . [ 38 ] 

The first part of the name, which identifies the genus, must be a word that can be treated as a Latin singular noun in the nominative case . It must be unique within the purview of each nomenclatural code , but can be repeated between them. Thus Huia recurvata is an extinct species of plant, found as fossils in Yunnan , China, [ 39 ] whereas Huia masonii is a species of frog found in Java , Indonesia. [ 40 ] 

The second part of the name, which identifies the species within the genus, is also treated grammatically as a Latin word. It can have one of a number of forms: 

- The second part of a binomial may be an adjective. If so, the form of the adjective must agree with the genus name in gender . Latin nouns can have three genders, masculine, feminine and neuter, and many Latin adjectives will have two or three different endings, depending upon the gender of the noun they refer to. The house sparrow has the binomial name Passer domesticus . Here domesticus ("domestic") simply means "associated with the house". The sacred bamboo is Nandina domestic a [ 41 ] rather than Nandina domestic us , since Nandina is feminine whereas Passer is masculine. The tropical fruit langsat is a product of the plant Lansium parasitic um , since Lansium is neuter. Some common endings for Latin adjectives in the three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter) are -us , -a , -um (as in the previous example of domesticus ); -is , -is , -e (e.g., tristis , meaning "sad"); and -or -or -us (e.g., minor , meaning "smaller"). For further information, see Latin declension: Adjectives . 
- The second part of a binomial may be a noun in the nominative case. An example is the binomial name of the lion, which is Panthera leo . Grammatically the noun is said to be in apposition to the genus name and the two nouns do not have to agree in gender; in this case, Panthera is feminine and leo is masculine. Magnolia hodgsonii 
- The second part of a binomial may be a noun in the genitive (possessive) case. The genitive case is constructed in a number of ways in Latin, depending on the declension of the noun. Common endings for masculine and neuter nouns are -ii or -i in the singular and -orum in the plural, and for feminine nouns -ae in the singular and -arum in the plural. The noun may be part of a person's name, often the surname, as in the Tibetan antelope ( Pantholops hodgsonii ), the shrub Magnolia hodgsonii , or the olive-backed pipit ( Anthus hodgsoni ). The meaning is "of the person named", so Magnolia hodgsonii means "Hodgson's magnolia". The -ii or -i endings show that in each case Hodgson was a man (not the same one); had Hodgson been a woman, hodgsonae would have been used. The person commemorated in the binomial name is not usually (if ever) the person who created the name; for example, Anthus hodgsoni was named by Charles Wallace Richmond , in honour of Hodgson. Rather than a person, the noun may be related to a place, as with Latimeria chalumnae , meaning "of the Chalumna River ". Another use of genitive nouns is in, for example, the name of the bacterium Escherichia coli , where coli means "of the colon ". This formation is common in parasites, as in Xenos vesparum , where vesparum means "of the wasps", since Xenos vesparum is a parasite of wasps. 

Whereas the first part of a binomial name must be unique within the purview of each nomenclatural code, the second part is quite commonly used in two or more genera (as is shown by examples of hodgsonii above), but cannot be used more than once within a single genus. The full binomial name must be unique within each code. 

# Codes 
[ edit ] 

From the early 19th century onwards it became ever more apparent that a body of rules was necessary to govern scientific names. In the course of time these became nomenclature codes . The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ( ICZN ) governs the naming of animals, [ 42 ] the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants ( ICNafp ) that of plants (including cyanobacteria ), and the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria ( ICNB ) that of bacteria (including Archaea ). Virus names are governed by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses ( ICTV ), a taxonomic code, which determines taxa as well as names. These codes differ in certain ways, e.g.: 

- "Binomial nomenclature" is the correct term for botany, [ 43 ] although it is also used by zoologists. [ 44 ] Since 1961, [ 45 ] "binomi n al nomenclature" is the technically correct term in zoology. [ 2 ] A binomial name is also called a binomen (plural binomina) or binominal name. [ 1 ] 
- Both codes consider the first part of the two-part name for a species to be the "generic name". In the zoological code ( ICZN ), the second part of the name is a "specific name". In the botanical code ( ICNafp ), it is a "specific epithet". Together, these two parts are referred to as a "species name" or "binomen" in the zoological code: or "species name", "binomial", or "binary combination" in the botanical code. "Species name" is the only term common to the two codes. 
- The ICNafp , the plant code, does not allow the two parts of a binomial name to be the same (such a name is called a tautonym ), whereas the ICZN , the animal code, does. Thus the American bison has the binomen Bison bison ; a name of this kind would not be allowed for a plant. 
- The starting points, the time from which these codes are in effect (retroactively), vary from group to group. In botany the starting point will often be in 1753 (the year Carl Linnaeus first published Species Plantarum ). In zoology the starting point is 1758 (1 January 1758 is considered the date of the publication of Linnaeus's Systema Naturae , 10th Edition, and also Clerck's Aranei Svecici ). Bacteriology started anew, with a starting point on 1 January 1980. [ 46 ] Summary of terminology for the names of species in the ICZN and ICNafp Code Full name First part Second part ICZN species name, binomen, binominal name generic name, genus name specific name ICNafp species name, binary combination, binomial (name) generic name specific epithet 

Unifying the different codes into a single code, the " BioCode ", has been suggested, [ 47 ] although implementation is not in sight. (There is also a published code for a different system of biotic nomenclature, which does not use ranks above species, but instead names clades . This is called PhyloCode .) 

# Differences in handling personal names 
[ edit ] 

As noted above, there are some differences between the codes in how binomials can be formed; for example the ICZN allows both parts to be the same, while the ICNafp does not. Another difference is in how personal names are used in forming specific names or epithets. The ICNafp sets out precise rules by which a personal name is to be converted to a specific epithet. In particular, names ending in a consonant (but not "er") are treated as first being converted into Latin by adding "-ius" (for a man) or "-ia" (for a woman), and then being made genitive (i.e. meaning "of that person or persons"). This produces specific epithets like lecardii for Lecard (male), wilsoniae for Wilson (female), and brauniarum for the Braun sisters. [ 48 ] By contrast, the ICZN does not require the intermediate creation of a Latin form of a personal name, allowing the genitive ending to be added directly to the personal name. [ 49 ] This explains the difference between the names of the plant Magnolia hodgsonii and the bird Anthus hodgsoni . Furthermore, the ICNafp requires names not published in the form required by the code to be corrected to conform to it, [ 50 ] whereas the ICZN is more protective of the form used by the original author. [ 51 ] 

# Writing binomial names 
[ edit ] 

By tradition, the binomial names of species are usually typeset in italics; for example, Homo sapiens . [ 52 ] Generally, the binomial should be printed in a font style different from that used in the normal text; for example, " Several more Homo sapiens fossils were discovered ." When handwritten, a binomial name should be underlined; for example, Homo sapiens . [ 53 ] 

The first part of the binomial, the genus name, is always written with an initial capital letter. Older sources, particularly botanical works published before the 1950s, used a different convention: if the second part of the name was derived from a proper noun, e.g., the name of a person or place, a capital letter was used. Thus, the modern form Berberis darwinii was written as Berberis Darwinii . A capital was also used when the name is formed by two nouns in apposition, e.g., Panthera Leo or Centaurea Cyanus . [ 54 ] [ note 3 ] In current usage, the second part is never written with an initial capital. [ 56 ] [ 57 ] 

When used with a common name, the scientific name often follows in parentheses, although this varies with publication. [ 58 ] For example, "The house sparrow ( Passer domesticus ) is decreasing in Europe." 

The binomial name should generally be written in full. The exception to this is when several species from the same genus are being listed or discussed in the same paper or report, or the same species is mentioned repeatedly; in which case the genus is written in full when it is first used, but may then be abbreviated to an initial (and a period/full stop). [ 59 ] For example, a list of members of the genus Canis might be written as " Canis lupus , C. aureus , C. simensis ". In rare cases, this abbreviated form has spread to more general use; for example, the bacterium Escherichia coli is often referred to as just E. coli , and Tyrannosaurus rex is perhaps even better known simply as T. rex , these two both often appearing in this form in popular writing even where the full genus name has not already been given. 

The abbreviation "sp." is used when the actual specific name cannot or need not be specified. The abbreviation "spp." (standing for species pluralis , Latin for "multiple species") indicates "several species". These abbreviations are not italicised (or underlined). [ 60 ] [ 61 ] For example: " Canis sp." means "an unspecified species of the genus Canis ", while " Canis spp." means "two or more species of the genus Canis ". (These abbreviations should not be confused with the abbreviations "ssp." (zoology) or "subsp." (botany), plurals "sspp." or "subspp.", referring to one or more subspecies . See trinomen (zoology) and infraspecific name .) 

The abbreviation " cf. " (i.e., confer in Latin) is used to compare individuals/taxa with known/described species. Conventions for use of the "cf." qualifier vary. [ 62 ] In paleontology, it is typically used when the identification is not confirmed. [ 63 ] For example, " Corvus cf. nasicus " was used to indicate "a fossil bird similar to the Cuban crow but not certainly identified as this species". [ 64 ] In molecular systematics papers, "cf." may be used to indicate one or more undescribed species assumed to be related to a described species. For example, in a paper describing the phylogeny of small benthic freshwater fish called darters, five undescribed putative species (Ozark, Sheltowee, Wildcat, Ihiyo, and Mamequit darters), notable for brightly colored nuptial males with distinctive color patterns, [ 65 ] were referred to as " Etheostoma cf. spectabile " because they had been viewed as related to, but distinct from, Etheostoma spectabile (orangethroat darter). [ 66 ] This view was supported to varying degrees by DNA analysis. The somewhat informal use of taxa names with qualifying abbreviations is referred to as open nomenclature and it is not subject to strict usage codes. 

In some contexts, the dagger symbol ("†") may be used before or after the binomial name to indicate that the species is extinct. 

# Authority 
[ edit ] 

Main articles: Author citation (zoology) and Author citation (botany) 

In scholarly texts, at least the first or main use of the binomial name is usually followed by the "authority" – a way of designating the scientist(s) who first published the name. The authority is written in slightly different ways in zoology and botany. For names governed by the ICZN the surname is usually written in full together with the date (normally only the year) of publication. One example of author citation of scientific name is: " Amabela Möschler, 1880 ." [ note 4 ] The ICZN recommends that the "original author and date of a name should be cited at least once in each work dealing with the taxon denoted by that name." [ 67 ] For names governed by the ICNafp the name is generally reduced to a standard abbreviation and the date omitted. The International Plant Names Index maintains an approved list of botanical author abbreviations. Historically, abbreviations were used in zoology too. 

When the original name is changed, e.g., the species is moved to a different genus, both codes use parentheses around the original authority; the ICNafp also requires the person who made the change to be given. In the ICNafp , the original name is then called the basionym . Some examples: 

- (Plant) Amaranthus retroflexus L. – "L." is the standard abbreviation for "Linnaeus"; the absence of parentheses shows that this is his original name. 
- (Plant) Hyacinthoides italica (L.) Rothm. – Linnaeus first named the Italian bluebell Scilla italica ; that is the basionym. Rothmaler later transferred it to the genus Hyacinthoides . 
- (Animal) Passer domesticus (Linnaeus, 1758) – the original name given by Linnaeus was Fringilla domestica ; unlike the ICNafp , the ICZN does not require the name of the person who changed the genus ( Mathurin Jacques Brisson [ 68 ] ) to be given. 

# Other ranks 
[ edit ] 

Main articles: Biological nomenclature , Trinomial nomenclature , and Infraspecific name (botany) 

Binomial nomenclature, as described here, is a system for naming species. Implicitly, it includes a system for naming genera, since the first part of the name of the species is a genus name. In a classification system based on ranks, there are also ways of naming ranks above the level of genus and below the level of species. Ranks above genus (e.g., family, order, class) receive one-part names, which are conventionally not written in italics. Thus, the house sparrow, Passer domesticus , belongs to the family Passeridae . Family names are normally based on genus names, such as in zoology, [ 69 ] although the endings used differ between zoology and botany. 

Ranks below species receive three-part names, conventionally written in italics like the names of species. There are significant differences between the ICZN and the ICNafp . In zoology, the only formal rank below species is subspecies and the name is written simply as three parts (a trinomen). Thus, one of the subspecies of the olive-backed pipit is Anthus hodgsoni berezowskii . Informally, in some circumstances, a form may be appended, though such names are unavailable, and have no formal standing in zoological nomenclature (i.e., they have no recognized author or date, and do not compete for homonymy). For example Harmonia axyridis f. spectabilis is the harlequin ladybird in its black or melanic forms having four large orange or red spots. In botany, there are many ranks below species and although the name itself is written in three parts, a "connecting term" (not part of the name) is needed to show the rank. Thus, the American black elder is Sambucus nigra subsp. canadensis ; the white-flowered form of the ivy-leaved cyclamen is Cyclamen hederifolium f. albiflorum . [ 70 ]

# Notes 
[ edit ] 

- ^ Some sources say that both John Tradescant the Younger and his father, John Tradescant the Elder , were intended by Linnaeus. 
- ^ The ending "-on" may derive from the neuter Greek ending - ον , as in Rhodoxylon floridum , or the masculine Greek ending - ων , as in Rhodochiton atrosanguineus . 
- ^ The modern notation was resisted by some, partly because writing names like Centaurea cyanus can suggest that cyanus is an adjective which should agree with Centaurea , i.e. that the name should be Centaurea cyana , whereas Cyanus is derived from the Greek name for the cornflower. [ 55 ] 
- ^ Here Amabela is the name of the genus . It is written in italic form. Followed by the last name of the scientist who discovered it (Heinrich Benno Möschler ), a comma, and the year when it was published.

Carl Linnaeus [ a ] (23 May 1707 [ note 1 ] – 10 January 1778), also known after ennoblement in 1761 as Carl von Linné , [ 3 ] [ b ] was a Swedish biologist and physician who formalised binomial nomenclature , the modern system of naming organisms. He is known as the "father of modern taxonomy ". [ 4 ] Many of his writings were in Latin; his name is rendered in Latin as Carolus Linnæus and, after his 1761 ennoblement, as Carolus a Linné . 

Linnaeus was the son of a curate [ 5 ] and was born in Råshult , in the countryside of Småland , southern Sweden . He received most of his higher education at Uppsala University and began giving lectures in botany there in 1730. He lived abroad between 1735 and 1738, where he studied and also published the first edition of his Systema Naturae in the Netherlands. He then returned to Sweden where he became professor of medicine and botany at Uppsala. In the 1740s, he was sent on several journeys through Sweden to find and classify plants and animals. In the 1750s and 1760s, he continued to collect and classify animals, plants, and minerals, while publishing several volumes. By the time of his death in 1778, he was one of the most acclaimed scientists in Europe. 

Linnaeus has been called Princeps botanicorum (Prince of Botanists) and "The Pliny of the North". [ 6 ] He is also considered one of the founders of modern ecology . [ 7 ] 

In botany, the abbreviation L. is used to indicate Linnaeus as the authority for a species' name. [ 8 ] In zoology, the abbreviation Linnaeus is generally used; the abbreviations L. , Linnæus , and Linné are also used. [ c ] In older publications, the abbreviation " Linn. " is found. Linnaeus's remains constitute the type specimen for the species Homo sapiens [ 9 ] following the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature , since the sole specimen that he is known to have examined was himself. [ note 2 ] 

# Early life 

# Childhood 

See also: Linné family 
Birthplace at Råshult 

Linnaeus was born in the village of Råshult in Småland , Sweden, on 23 May 1707. He was the first child of Nicolaus (Nils) Ingemarsson (who later adopted the family name Linnaeus) and Christina Brodersonia. His siblings were Anna Maria Linnæa, Sofia Juliana Linnæa, Samuel Linnæus (who would eventually succeed their father as rector of Stenbrohult and write a manual on beekeeping ), [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] and Emerentia Linnæa. [ citation needed ] His father taught him Latin as a small child. [ 13 ] 

One of a long line of peasants and priests, Nils was an amateur botanist , a Lutheran minister, and the curate of the small village of Stenbrohult in Småland. Christina was the daughter of the rector of Stenbrohult, Samuel Brodersonius. [ 14 ] 

A year after Linnaeus's birth, his grandfather Samuel Brodersonius died, and his father Nils became the rector of Stenbrohult. The family moved into the rectory from the curate's house. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] 

Even in his early years, Linnaeus seemed to have a liking for plants, flowers in particular. Whenever he was upset, he was given a flower, which immediately calmed him. Nils spent much time in his garden and often showed flowers to Linnaeus and told him their names. Soon Linnaeus was given his own patch of earth where he could grow plants. [ 17 ] 

Carl's father was the first in his ancestry to adopt a permanent surname. Before that, ancestors had used the patronymic naming system of Scandinavian countries: his father was named Ingemarsson after his father Ingemar Bengtsson. When Nils was admitted to the Lund University , he had to take on a family name. He adopted the Latinate name Linnæus after a giant linden tree (or lime tree), lind in Swedish, that grew on the family homestead. [ 10 ] This name was spelled with the æ ligature . When Carl was born, he was named Carl Linnæus, with his father's family name. The son also always spelled it with the æ ligature, both in handwritten documents and in publications. [ 15 ] Carl's patronymic would have been Nilsson, as in Carl Nilsson Linnæus. [ 18 ] 

# Early education 

Örtaboken (Herb book), an early Linnaeus manuscript, 1725 

Linnaeus's father began teaching him basic Latin, religion, and geography at an early age. [ 19 ] When Linnaeus was seven, Nils decided to hire a tutor for him. The parents picked Johan Telander, a son of a local yeoman . Linnaeus did not like him, writing in his autobiography that Telander "was better calculated to extinguish a child's talents than develop them". [ 20 ] 

Two years after his tutoring had begun, he was sent to the Lower Grammar School at Växjö in 1717. [ 21 ] Linnaeus rarely studied, often going to the countryside to look for plants. At some point, his father went to visit him and, after hearing critical assessments by his preceptors, he decided to put the youth as an apprentice to some honest cobbler. [ 22 ] He reached the last year of the Lower School when he was fifteen, which was taught by the headmaster, Daniel Lannerus, who was interested in botany. Lannerus noticed Linnaeus's interest in botany and gave him the run of his garden. 

He also introduced him to Johan Rothman, the state doctor of Småland and a teacher at Katedralskolan (a gymnasium ) in Växjö. Also a botanist, Rothman broadened Linnaeus's interest in botany and helped him develop an interest in medicine. [ 23 ] [ 24 ] By the age of 17, Linnaeus had become well acquainted with the existing botanical literature. He remarks in his journal that he "read day and night, knowing like the back of my hand, Arvidh Månsson's Rydaholm Book of Herbs , Tillandz's Flora Åboensis , Palmberg's Serta Florea Suecana , Bromelii's Chloros Gothica and Rudbeckii's Hortus Upsaliensis ". [ 25 ] 

Linnaeus entered the Växjö Katedralskola in 1724, where he studied mainly Greek , Hebrew , theology , and mathematics , a curriculum designed for boys preparing for the priesthood. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] In the last year at the gymnasium, Linnaeus's father visited to ask the professors how his son's studies were progressing; to his dismay, most said that the boy would never become a scholar. Rothman believed otherwise, suggesting Linnaeus could have a future in medicine. The doctor offered to have Linnaeus live with his family in Växjö and to teach him physiology and botany. Nils accepted this offer. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] 

# University studies 

# Lund

Rothman showed Linnaeus that botany was a serious subject. He taught Linnaeus to classify plants according to Tournefort's system. Linnaeus was also taught about the sexual reproduction of plants, according to Sébastien Vaillant . [ 28 ] In 1727, Linnaeus, age 21, enrolled in Lund University in Skåne . [ 30 ] [ 31 ] He was registered as Carolus Linnæus , the Latin form of his full name, which he also used later for his Latin publications. [ 3 ] 

Professor Kilian Stobæus , natural scientist, physician and historian, offered Linnaeus tutoring and lodging, as well as the use of his library, which included many books about botany. He also gave the student free admission to his lectures. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] In his spare time, Linnaeus explored the flora of Skåne, together with students sharing the same interests. [ 34 ] 

# Uppsala 

Pollination depicted in Praeludia Sponsaliorum Plantarum (1729) 

In August 1728, Linnaeus decided to attend Uppsala University on the advice of Rothman, who believed it would be a better choice if Linnaeus wanted to study both medicine and botany. Rothman based this recommendation on the two professors who taught at the medical faculty at Uppsala: Olof Rudbeck the Younger and Lars Roberg . Although Rudbeck and Roberg had undoubtedly been good professors, by then they were older and not so interested in teaching. Rudbeck no longer gave public lectures, and had others stand in for him. The botany, zoology, pharmacology and anatomy lectures were not in their best state. [ 35 ] In Uppsala, Linnaeus met a new benefactor, Olof Celsius , who was a professor of theology and an amateur botanist. [ 36 ] He received Linnaeus into his home and allowed him use of his library, which was one of the richest botanical libraries in Sweden. [ 37 ] 

In 1729, Linnaeus wrote a thesis, Praeludia Sponsaliorum Plantarum on plant sexual reproduction . This attracted the attention of Rudbeck; in May 1730, he selected Linnaeus to give lectures at the University although the young man was only a second-year student. His lectures were popular, and Linnaeus often addressed an audience of 300 people. [ 38 ] In June, Linnaeus moved from Celsius's house to Rudbeck's to become the tutor of the three youngest of his 24 children. His friendship with Celsius did not wane and they continued their botanical expeditions. [ 39 ] Over that winter, Linnaeus began to doubt Tournefort's system of classification and decided to create one of his own. His plan was to divide the plants by the number of stamens and pistils . He began writing several books, which would later result in, for example, Genera Plantarum and Critica Botanica . He also produced a book on the plants grown in the Uppsala Botanical Garden , Adonis Uplandicus . [ 40 ] 

Rudbeck's former assistant, Nils Rosén , returned to the University in March 1731 with a degree in medicine. Rosén started giving anatomy lectures and tried to take over Linnaeus's botany lectures, but Rudbeck prevented that. Until December, Rosén tutored Linnaeus privately in medicine. In December, Linnaeus had a "disagreement" with Rudbeck's wife and had to move out of his mentor's house; his relationship with Rudbeck did not appear to suffer. That Christmas, Linnaeus returned home to Stenbrohult to visit his parents for the first time in about three years. His mother had disapproved of his failing to become a priest, but she was pleased to learn he was teaching at the University. [ 40 ] [ 41 ] 

# Expedition to Lapland 

Main articles: Expedition to Lapland and Flora Lapponica 
Carl Linnaeus in Laponian costume (1737) 

During a visit with his parents, Linnaeus told them about his plan to travel to Lapland ; Rudbeck had made the journey in 1695, but the detailed results of his exploration were lost in a fire seven years afterwards. Linnaeus's hope was to find new plants, animals and possibly valuable minerals. He was also curious about the customs of the native Sami people , reindeer-herding nomads who wandered Scandinavia's vast tundras. In April 1732, Linnaeus was awarded a grant from the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala for his journey. [ 42 ] [ 43 ]

Linnaeus began his expedition from Uppsala on 12 May 1732, just before he turned 25. [ 44 ] He travelled on foot and horse, bringing with him his journal, botanical and ornithological manuscripts and sheets of paper for pressing plants. Near Gävle he found great quantities of Campanula serpyllifolia , later known as Linnaea borealis , the twinflower that would become his favourite. [ 45 ] He sometimes dismounted on the way to examine a flower or rock [ 46 ] and was particularly interested in mosses and lichens , the latter a main part of the diet of the reindeer , a common and economically important animal in Lapland. [ 47 ] 

Linnaeus travelled clockwise around the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia , making major inland incursions from Umeå , Luleå and Tornio . He returned from his six-month-long, over 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) expedition in October, having gathered and observed many plants, birds and rocks. [ 48 ] [ 49 ] [ 50 ] Although Lapland was a region with limited biodiversity , Linnaeus described about 100 previously unidentified plants. These became the basis of his book Flora Lapponica . [ 51 ] [ 52 ] However, on the expedition to Lapland, Linnaeus used Latin names to describe organisms because he had not yet developed the binomial system. [ 44 ] 

In Flora Lapponica Linnaeus's ideas about nomenclature and classification were first used in a practical way, making this the first proto-modern Flora . [ 53 ] The account covered 534 species, used the Linnaean classification system and included, for the described species, geographical distribution and taxonomic notes. It was Augustin Pyramus de Candolle who attributed Linnaeus with Flora Lapponica as the first example in the botanical genre of Flora writing. Botanical historian E. L. Greene described Flora Lapponica as "the most classic and delightful" of Linnaeus's works. [ 53 ] 

It was during this expedition that Linnaeus had a flash of insight regarding the classification of mammals. Upon observing the lower jawbone of a horse at the side of a road he was travelling, Linnaeus remarked: "If I only knew how many teeth and of what kind every animal had, how many teats and where they were placed, I should perhaps be able to work out a perfectly natural system for the arrangement of all quadrupeds." [ 54 ] 

In 1734, Linnaeus led a small group of students to Dalarna . Funded by the Governor of Dalarna, the expedition was to catalogue known natural resources and discover new ones, but also to gather intelligence on Norwegian mining activities at Røros . [ 50 ]

The work was a collaboration between Linnaeus and Georg Dionysius Ehret , financed by George Clifford III , one of the directors of the VOC . 

# Doctorate 

Cities where he worked; those outside Sweden were only visited during 1735–1738 

His relations with Nils Rosén having worsened, Linnaeus accepted an invitation from Claes Sohlberg, son of a mining inspector, to spend the Christmas holiday in Falun , where Linnaeus was permitted to visit the mines. [ 55 ] 

In April 1735, at the suggestion of Sohlberg's father, Linnaeus and Sohlberg set out for the Dutch Republic , where Linnaeus intended to study medicine at the University of Harderwijk [ 56 ] while tutoring Sohlberg in exchange for an annual salary. At the time, it was common for Swedes to pursue doctoral degrees in the Netherlands , then a highly revered place to study natural history. [ 57 ] 

On the way, the pair stopped in Hamburg , where they met the mayor, who proudly showed them a supposed wonder of nature in his possession: the taxidermied remains of a seven-headed hydra . Linnaeus quickly discovered the specimen was a fake , cobbled together from the jaws and paws of weasels and the skins of snakes. The provenance of the hydra suggested to Linnaeus that it had been manufactured by monks to represent the Beast of Revelation . Even at the risk of incurring the mayor's wrath, Linnaeus made his observations public, dashing the mayor's dreams of selling the hydra for an enormous sum. Linnaeus and Sohlberg were forced to flee from Hamburg. [ 58 ] [ 59 ] 

Linnaeus began working towards his degree as soon as he reached Harderwijk , a university known for awarding degrees in as little as a week. [ 60 ] He submitted a dissertation, written back in Sweden, entitled Dissertatio medica inauguralis in qua exhibetur hypothesis nova de febrium intermittentium causa , [ note 3 ] in which he laid out his hypothesis that malaria arose only in areas with clay-rich soils. [ 61 ] Although he failed to identify the true source of disease transmission, (i.e., the Anopheles mosquito ), [ 62 ] he did correctly predict that Artemisia annua ( wormwood ) would become a source of antimalarial medications. [ 61 ] 

Within two weeks he had completed his oral and practical examinations and was awarded a doctoral degree. [ 58 ] [ 60 ] 

That summer Linnaeus reunited with Peter Artedi , a friend from Uppsala with whom he had once made a pact that should either of the two predecease the other, the survivor would finish the decedent's work. Ten weeks later, Artedi drowned in the canals of Amsterdam , leaving behind an unfinished manuscript on the classification of fish. [ 63 ] [ 64 ] 

# Publishing of Systema Naturae 

One of the first scientists Linnaeus met in the Netherlands was Johan Frederik Gronovius , to whom Linnaeus showed one of the several manuscripts he had brought with him from Sweden. The manuscript described a new system for classifying plants. When Gronovius saw it, he was very impressed, and offered to help pay for the printing. With an additional monetary contribution by the Scottish doctor Isaac Lawson , the manuscript was published as Systema Naturae (1735). [ 65 ] [ 66 ] 

Linnaeus became acquainted with one of the most respected physicians and botanists in the Netherlands, Herman Boerhaave , who tried to convince Linnaeus to make a career there. Boerhaave offered him a journey to South Africa and America, but Linnaeus declined, stating he would not stand the heat. Instead, Boerhaave convinced Linnaeus that he should visit the botanist Johannes Burman . After his visit, Burman, impressed with his guest's knowledge, decided Linnaeus should stay with him during the winter. During his stay, Linnaeus helped Burman with his Thesaurus Zeylanicus . Burman also helped Linnaeus with the books on which he was working: Fundamenta Botanica and Bibliotheca Botanica . [ 67 ] 

# George Clifford, Philip Miller, and Johann Jacob Dillenius 

Leaf forms from Hortus Cliffortianus 

In August 1735, during Linnaeus's stay with Burman, he met George Clifford III , a director of the Dutch East India Company and the owner of a rich botanical garden at the estate of Hartekamp in Heemstede . Clifford was very impressed with Linnaeus's ability to classify plants, and invited him to become his physician and superintendent of his garden. Linnaeus had already agreed to stay with Burman over the winter, and could thus not accept immediately. However, Clifford offered to compensate Burman by offering him a copy of Sir Hans Sloane's Natural History of Jamaica , a rare book, if he let Linnaeus stay with him, and Burman accepted. [ 68 ] [ 69 ] On 24 September 1735, Linnaeus moved to Hartekamp to become personal physician to Clifford, and curator of Clifford's herbarium. He was paid 1,000 florins a year, with free board and lodging. Though the agreement was only for a winter of that year, Linnaeus practically stayed there until 1738. [ 70 ] It was here that he wrote a book Hortus Cliffortianus , in the preface of which he described his experience as "the happiest time of my life". (A portion of Hartekamp was declared as public garden in April 1956 by the Heemstede local authority, and was named "Linnaeushof". [ 71 ] It eventually became, as it is claimed, the biggest playground in Europe. [ 72 ] ) 

In July 1736, Linnaeus travelled to England, at Clifford's expense. [ 73 ] He went to London to visit Sir Hans Sloane, a collector of natural history, and to see his cabinet , [ 74 ] as well as to visit the Chelsea Physic Garden and its keeper, Philip Miller . He taught Miller about his new system of subdividing plants, as described in Systema Naturae . At first, Miller was reluctant to use the new binomial nomenclature , preferring instead the classifications of Joseph Pitton de Tournefort and John Ray . Nevertheless, Linnaeus applauded Miller's Gardeners Dictionary . [ 75 ] The conservative Miller actually retained in his dictionary a number of pre-Linnaean binomial signifiers discarded by Linnaeus but which have been retained by modern botanists. He only fully changed to the Linnaean system in the edition of The Gardeners Dictionary of 1768. Miller ultimately was impressed, and from then on started to arrange the garden according to Linnaeus's system. [ 76 ] 

Linnaeus also travelled to Oxford University to visit the botanist Johann Jacob Dillenius . He failed to make Dillenius publicly fully accept his new classification system, though the two men remained in correspondence for many years afterwards. Linnaeus dedicated his Critica Botanica to him, as " opus botanicum quo absolutius mundus non-vidit ". Linnaeus would later name a genus of tropical tree Dillenia in his honour. He then returned to Hartekamp, bringing with him many specimens of rare plants. [ 77 ] The next year, 1737, he published Genera Plantarum , in which he described 935 genera of plants, and shortly thereafter he supplemented it with Corollarium Generum Plantarum , with another sixty ( sexaginta ) genera. [ 78 ] 

His work at Hartekamp led to another book, Hortus Cliffortianus , a catalogue of the botanical holdings in the herbarium and botanical garden of Hartekamp. He wrote it in nine months (completed in July 1737), but it was not published until 1738. [ 67 ] It contains the first use of the name Nepenthes , which Linnaeus used to describe a genus of pitcher plants . [ 79 ] [ note 4 ] 

Linnaeus stayed with Clifford at Hartekamp until 18 October 1737 (new style), when he left the house to return to Sweden. Illness and the kindness of Dutch friends obliged him to stay some months longer in Holland. In May 1738, he set out for Sweden again. On the way home, he stayed in Paris for about a month, visiting botanists such as Antoine de Jussieu . After his return, Linnaeus never again left Sweden. [ 80 ] [ 81 ] 

# Return to Sweden 

Wedding portrait 

When Linnaeus returned to Sweden on 28 June 1738, he went to Falun , where he entered into an engagement to Sara Elisabeth Moræa . Three months later, he moved to Stockholm to find employment as a physician, and thus to make it possible to support a family. [ 82 ] [ 83 ] Once again, Linnaeus found a patron; he became acquainted with Count Carl Gustav Tessin , who helped him get work as a physician at the Admiralty. [ 84 ] [ 85 ] During this time in Stockholm, Linnaeus helped found the Royal Swedish Academy of Science ; he became the first Praeses of the academy by drawing of lots. [ 86 ] 

Because his finances had improved and were now sufficient to support a family, he received permission to marry his fiancée, Sara Elisabeth Moræa. Their wedding was held 26 June 1739. Seventeen months later, Sara gave birth to their first son, Carl . Two years later, a daughter, Elisabeth Christina , was born, and the subsequent year Sara gave birth to Sara Magdalena, who died when 15 days old. Sara and Linnaeus would later have four other children: Lovisa, Sara Christina, Johannes and Sophia. [ 82 ] [ 87 ] 
House in Uppsala 

In May 1741, Linnaeus was appointed Professor of Medicine at Uppsala University, first with responsibility for medicine-related matters. Soon, he changed place with the other Professor of Medicine, Nils Rosén, and thus was responsible for the Botanical Garden (which he would thoroughly reconstruct and expand), botany and natural history , instead. In October that same year, his wife and nine-month-old son followed him to live in Uppsala. [ 88 ] 

# Öland and Gotland 

Ten days after he was appointed professor, he undertook an expedition to the island provinces of Öland and Gotland with six students from the university to look for plants useful in medicine. They stayed on Öland until 21 June, then sailed to Visby in Gotland. Linnaeus and the students stayed on Gotland for about a month, and then returned to Uppsala. During this expedition, they found 100 previously unrecorded plants. The observations from the expedition were later published in Öländska och Gothländska Resa , written in Swedish. Like Flora Lapponica , it contained both zoological and botanical observations, as well as observations concerning the culture in Öland and Gotland. [ 89 ] [ 90 ] 

During the summer of 1745, Linnaeus published two more books: Flora Suecica and Fauna Suecica . Flora Suecica was a strictly botanical book, while Fauna Suecica was zoological . [ 82 ] [ 91 ] Anders Celsius had created the temperature scale named after him in 1742. Celsius's scale was originally inverted compared to the way it is used today, with water boiling at 0 °C and freezing at 100 °C. Linnaeus was the one who inverted the scale to its present usage, in 1745. [ 92 ] 

# Västergötland 

In the summer of 1746, Linnaeus was once again commissioned by the Government to carry out an expedition, this time to the Swedish province of Västergötland . He set out from Uppsala on 12 June and returned on 11 August. On the expedition his primary companion was Erik Gustaf Lidbeck, a student who had accompanied him on his previous journey. Linnaeus described his findings from the expedition in the book Wästgöta-Resa , published the next year. [ 89 ] [ 93 ] After he returned from the journey, the Government decided Linnaeus should take on another expedition to the southernmost province Scania . This journey was postponed, as Linnaeus felt too busy. [ 82 ] 

In 1747, Linnaeus was given the title archiater , or chief physician, by the Swedish king Adolf Frederick —a mark of great respect. [ 94 ] The same year he was elected member of the Academy of Sciences in Berlin . [ 95 ] 

# Scania 

In the spring of 1749, Linnaeus could finally journey to Scania , again commissioned by the government. With him he brought his student Olof Söderberg. On the way to Scania, he made his last visit to his brothers and sisters in Stenbrohult since his father had died the previous year. The expedition was similar to the previous journeys in most aspects, but this time he was also ordered to find the best place to grow walnut and Swedish whitebeam trees; these trees were used by the military to make rifles. While there, they also visited the Ramlösa mineral spa , where he remarked on the quality of its ferruginous water. [ 96 ] The journey was successful, and Linnaeus's observations were published the next year in Skånska Resa . [ 97 ] [ 98 ]

Summer home at his Hammarby estate The Linnaean Garden in Uppsala 

In 1750, Linnaeus became rector of Uppsala University, starting a period where natural sciences were esteemed. [ 82 ] Perhaps the most important contribution he made during his time at Uppsala was to teach; many of his students travelled to various places in the world to collect botanical samples. Linnaeus called the best of these students his "apostles". [ 99 ] His lectures were normally very popular and were often held in the Botanical Garden. He tried to teach the students to think for themselves and not trust anybody, not even him. Even more popular than the lectures were the botanical excursions made every Saturday during summer, where Linnaeus and his students explored the flora and fauna in the vicinity of Uppsala. [ 100 ] 

# Philosophia Botanica 

Linnaeus published Philosophia Botanica in 1751. [ 101 ] The book contained a complete survey of the taxonomy system he had been using in his earlier works. It also contained information of how to keep a journal on travels and how to maintain a botanical garden. [ 102 ] 

# Nutrix Noverca 

Cover of Nutrix Noverca (1752) 

During Linnaeus's time it was normal for upper class women to have wet nurses for their babies. Linnaeus joined an ongoing campaign to end this practice in Sweden and promote breast-feeding by mothers. In 1752 Linnaeus published a thesis along with Frederick Lindberg, a physician student, [ 103 ] based on their experiences. [ 104 ] In the tradition of the period, this dissertation was essentially an idea of the presiding reviewer ( prases ) expounded upon by the student. Linnaeus's dissertation was translated into French by J. E. Gilibert in 1770 as La Nourrice marâtre, ou Dissertation sur les suites funestes du nourrisage mercénaire . Linnaeus suggested that children might absorb the personality of their wet nurse through the milk. He admired the child care practices of the Lapps [ 105 ] and pointed out how healthy their babies were compared to those of Europeans who employed wet nurses. He compared the behaviour of wild animals and pointed out how none of them denied their newborns their breastmilk. [ 105 ] It is thought that his activism played a role in his choice of the term Mammalia for the class of organisms. [ 106 ] 

# Species Plantarum 

Main article: Species Plantarum 

Linnaeus published Species Plantarum , the work which is now internationally accepted as the starting point of modern botanical nomenclature , in 1753. [ 107 ] The first volume was issued on 24 May, the second volume followed on 16 August of the same year. [ note 5 ] [ 109 ] The book contained 1,200 pages and was published in two volumes; it described over 7,300 species. [ 110 ] [ 111 ] The same year the king dubbed him knight of the Order of the Polar Star , the first civilian in Sweden to become a knight in this order. He was then seldom seen not wearing the order's insignia. [ 112 ] 

# Ennoblement 

His coat of arms 

Linnaeus felt Uppsala was too noisy and unhealthy, so he bought two farms in 1758: Hammarby and Sävja. The next year, he bought a neighbouring farm, Edeby. He spent the summers with his family at Hammarby; initially it only had a small one-storey house, but in 1762 a new, larger main building was added. [ 98 ] [ 113 ] In Hammarby, Linnaeus made a garden where he could grow plants that could not be grown in the Botanical Garden in Uppsala. He began constructing a museum on a hill behind Hammarby in 1766, where he moved his library and collection of plants. A fire that destroyed about one third of Uppsala and had threatened his residence there necessitated the move. [ 114 ] 

Since the initial release of Systema Naturae in 1735, the book had been expanded and reprinted several times; the tenth edition was released in 1758. This edition established itself as the starting point for zoological nomenclature , the equivalent of Species Plantarum . [ 110 ] [ 115 ] 

The Swedish King Adolf Frederick granted Linnaeus nobility in 1757, but he was not ennobled until 1761. With his ennoblement, he took the name Carl von Linné (Latinised as Carolus a Linné ), 'Linné' being a shortened and gallicised version of 'Linnæus', and the German nobiliary particle ' von ' signifying his ennoblement. [ 3 ] The noble family's coat of arms prominently features a twinflower , one of Linnaeus's favourite plants; it was given the scientific name Linnaea borealis in his honour by Gronovius . The shield in the coat of arms is divided into thirds: red, black and green for the three kingdoms of nature (animal, mineral and vegetable) in Linnaean classification; in the centre is an egg "to denote Nature, which is continued and perpetuated in ovo ". At the bottom is a phrase in Latin, borrowed from the Aeneid , which reads " Famam extendere factis ": we extend our fame by our deeds. [ 116 ] [ 117 ] [ 118 ] Linnaeus inscribed this personal motto in books that were given to him by friends. [ 119 ] 

After his ennoblement, Linnaeus continued teaching and writing. In total, he presided at 186 PhD ceremonies, with many of the dissertations written by himself. [ 120 ] His reputation had spread over the world, and he corresponded with many different people. For example, Catherine II of Russia sent him seeds from her country. [ 121 ] He also corresponded with Giovanni Antonio Scopoli , "the Linnaeus of the Austrian Empire", who was a doctor and a botanist in Idrija , Duchy of Carniola (nowadays Slovenia ). [ 122 ] Scopoli communicated all of his research, findings, and descriptions (for example of the olm and the dormouse , two little animals hitherto unknown to Linnaeus). Linnaeus greatly respected Scopoli and showed great interest in his work. He named a solanaceous genus, Scopolia , the source of scopolamine , after him, but because of the great distance between them, they never met. [ 123 ] [ 124 ] 

# Final years 

Headstone of him and his son Carl Linnaeus the Younger 

Linnaeus was relieved of his duties in the Royal Swedish Academy of Science in 1763, but continued his work there as usual for more than ten years after. [ 82 ] In 1769 he was elected to the American Philosophical Society for his work. [ 125 ] He stepped down as rector at Uppsala University in December 1772, mostly due to his declining health. [ 81 ] [ 126 ] 

Linnaeus's last years were troubled by illness. He had had a disease called the Uppsala fever in 1764, but survived due to the care of Rosén. He developed sciatica in 1773, and the next year, he had a stroke which partially paralysed him. [ 127 ] He had a second stroke in 1776, losing the use of his right side and leaving him bereft of his memory; while still able to admire his own writings, he could not recognise himself as their author. [ 128 ] [ 129 ] 

In December 1777, he had another stroke which greatly weakened him, and eventually led to his death on 10 January 1778 in Hammarby. [ 130 ] [ 126 ] Despite his desire to be buried in Hammarby, he was buried in Uppsala Cathedral on 22 January. [ 131 ] [ 132 ] 

His library and collections were left to his widow Sara and their children. Joseph Banks , an eminent botanist, wished to purchase the collection, but his son Carl refused the offer and instead moved the collection to Uppsala. In 1783 Carl died and Sara inherited the collection, having outlived both her husband and son. She tried to sell it to Banks, but he was no longer interested; instead an acquaintance of his agreed to buy the collection. The acquaintance was a 24-year-old medical student, James Edward Smith , who bought the whole collection: 14,000 plants, 3,198 insects, 1,564 shells, about 3,000 letters and 1,600 books. Smith founded the Linnean Society of London five years later. [ 132 ] [ 133 ] 

The von Linné name ended with his son Carl, who never married. [ 134 ] His other son, Johannes, had died aged 3. [ 135 ] There are over two hundred descendants of Linnaeus through two of his daughters. [ 134 ] 

# Apostles 

Main article: Apostles of Linnaeus 
Carl Peter Thunberg was a VOC physician and an apostle of Linnaeus . Peter Forsskål was among the apostles who met a tragic fate abroad. 

During Linnaeus's time as Professor and Rector of Uppsala University, he taught many devoted students , 17 of whom he called "apostles". They were the most promising, most committed students, and all of them made botanical expeditions to various places in the world, often with his help. The amount of this help varied; sometimes he used his influence as Rector to grant his apostles a scholarship or a place on an expedition. [ 136 ] To most of the apostles he gave instructions of what to look for on their journeys. Abroad, the apostles collected and organised new plants, animals and minerals according to Linnaeus's system. Most of them also gave some of their collection to Linnaeus when their journey was finished. [ 137 ] Thanks to these students, the Linnaean system of taxonomy spread through the world without Linnaeus ever having to travel outside Sweden after his return from Holland. [ 138 ] The British botanist William T. Stearn notes, without Linnaeus's new system, it would not have been possible for the apostles to collect and organise so many new specimens. [ 139 ] Many of the apostles died during their expeditions. 

# Early expeditions 

Christopher Tärnström, the first apostle and a 43-year-old pastor with a wife and children, made his journey in 1746. He boarded a Swedish East India Company ship headed for China. Tärnström never reached his destination, dying of a tropical fever on Côn Sơn Island the same year. Tärnström's widow blamed Linnaeus for making her children fatherless, causing Linnaeus to prefer sending out younger, unmarried students after Tärnström. [ 140 ] Six other apostles later died on their expeditions, including Pehr Forsskål and Pehr Löfling . [ 139 ] 

Two years after Tärnström's expedition, Finnish-born Pehr Kalm set out as the second apostle to North America. There he spent two-and-a-half years studying the flora and fauna of Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and Canada. Linnaeus was overjoyed when Kalm returned, bringing back with him many pressed flowers and seeds. At least 90 of the 700 North American species described in Species Plantarum had been brought back by Kalm. [ 141 ] 

# Cook expeditions and Japan 

Apostle Daniel Solander (far left) with Joseph Banks (left, sitting) accompanied James Cook (centre) on his journey to Australia. 

Daniel Solander was living in Linnaeus's house during his time as a student in Uppsala. Linnaeus was very fond of him, promising Solander his eldest daughter's hand in marriage. On Linnaeus's recommendation, Solander travelled to England in 1760, where he met the English botanist Joseph Banks . With Banks, Solander joined James Cook on his expedition to Oceania on the Endeavour in 1768–71. [ 142 ] [ 143 ] Solander was not the only apostle to journey with James Cook; Anders Sparrman followed on the Resolution in 1772–75 bound for, among other places, Oceania and South America. Sparrman made many other expeditions, one of them to South Africa. [ 144 ] 

Perhaps the most famous and successful apostle was Carl Peter Thunberg , who embarked on a nine-year expedition in 1770. He stayed in South Africa for three years, then travelled to Japan . All foreigners were barred from entering Japan and  were restricted to  the tiny island of Dejima outside Nagasaki , so it was thus hard for Thunberg to study the flora. He did, however, manage to persuade some of the translators to bring him different plants, and he also found plants in the gardens of Dejima. He returned to Sweden in 1779, one year after Linnaeus's death. [ 145 ] 

# Major publications

# Systema Naturae 

Title page of the 10th edition of Systema Naturæ (1758) 

Main article: Systema Naturae 

The first edition of Systema Naturae was printed in the Netherlands in 1735. It was a twelve-page work. [ 146 ] By the time it reached its 10th edition in 1758, it classified 4,400 species of animals and 7,700 species of plants. People from all over the world sent their specimens to Linnaeus to be included. By the time he started work on the 12th edition, Linnaeus needed a new invention—the index card —to track classifications. [ 147 ] 

In Systema Naturae , the unwieldy names mostly used at the time, such as " Physalis annua ramosissima, ramis angulosis glabris, foliis dentato-serratis ", were supplemented with concise and now familiar "binomials", composed of the generic name, followed by a specific epithet—in the case given, Physalis angulata . These binomials could serve as a label to refer to the species. Higher taxa were constructed and arranged in a simple and orderly manner. Although the system, now known as binomial nomenclature , was partially developed by the Bauhin brothers (see Gaspard Bauhin and Johann Bauhin ) almost 200 years earlier, [ 148 ] Linnaeus was the first to use it consistently throughout the work, including in monospecific genera, and may be said to have popularised it within the scientific community. 

After the decline in Linnaeus's health in the early 1770s, publication of editions of Systema Naturae went in two different directions. Another Swedish scientist, Johan Andreas Murray , issued the Regnum Vegetabile section separately in 1774 as the Systema Vegetabilium , rather confusingly labelled the 13th edition. [ 149 ] Meanwhile, a 13th edition of the entire Systema appeared in parts between 1788 and 1793 under the editorship of Johann Friedrich Gmelin . It was through the Systema Vegetabilium that Linnaeus's work became widely known in England, following its translation from the Latin by the Lichfield Botanical Society as A System of Vegetables (1783–1785). [ 150 ] 

# Orbis eruditi judicium de Caroli Linnaei MD scriptis 

('Opinion of the learned world on the writings of Carl Linnaeus, Doctor') Published in 1740, this small octavo-sized pamphlet was presented to the State Library of New South Wales by the Linnean Society of NSW in 2018. This is considered among the rarest of all the writings of Linnaeus, and crucial to his career, securing him his appointment to a professorship of medicine at Uppsala University. From this position he laid the groundwork for his radical new theory of classifying and naming organisms for which he was considered the founder of modern taxonomy. 

# Species Plantarum 

Main article: Species Plantarum 

Species Plantarum (or, more fully, Species Plantarum, exhibentes plantas rite cognitas, ad genera relatas, cum differentiis specificis, nominibus trivialibus, synonymis selectis, locis natalibus, secundum systema sexuale digestas ) was first published in 1753, as a two-volume work. Its prime importance is perhaps that it is the primary starting point of plant nomenclature as it exists today. [ 107 ] 

# Genera Plantarum 

Main article: Genera Plantarum 

Genera plantarum: eorumque characteres naturales secundum numerum, figuram, situm, et proportionem omnium fructificationis partium was first published in 1737, delineating plant genera. Around 10 editions were published, not all of them by Linnaeus himself; the most important is the 1754 fifth edition. [ 151 ] In it Linnaeus divided the plant Kingdom into 24 classes. One, Cryptogamia , included all the plants with concealed reproductive parts (algae, fungi, mosses and liverworts and ferns). [ 152 ] 

# Philosophia Botanica 

Main article: Philosophia Botanica 

Philosophia Botanica (1751) [ 101 ] was a summary of Linnaeus's thinking on plant classification and nomenclature, and an elaboration of the work he had previously published in Fundamenta Botanica (1736) and Critica Botanica (1737). Other publications forming part of his plan to reform the foundations of botany include his Classes Plantarum and Bibliotheca Botanica : all were printed in Holland (as were Genera Plantarum (1737) and Systema Naturae (1735)), the Philosophia being simultaneously released in Stockholm. [ 153 ] 

# Collections 

Linnaeus marble by Léon-Joseph Chavalliaud (1899), outside the Palm House at Sefton Park in Liverpool 

At the end of his lifetime the Linnean collection in Uppsala was considered one of the finest collections of natural history objects in Sweden. Next to his own collection he had also built up a museum for the university of Uppsala, which was supplied by material donated by Carl Gyllenborg (in 1744–1745), crown-prince Adolf Fredrik (in 1745), Erik Petreus (in 1746), Claes Grill (in 1746), Magnus Lagerström (in 1748 and 1750) and Jonas Alströmer (in 1749). The relation between the museum and the private collection was not formalised and the steady flow of material from Linnean pupils were incorporated to the private collection rather than to the museum. [ 154 ] Linnaeus felt his work was reflecting the harmony of nature and he said in 1754 "the earth is then nothing else but a museum of the all-wise creator's masterpieces, divided into three chambers". He had turned his own estate into a microcosm of that 'world museum'. [ 155 ] 

In April 1766 parts of the town were destroyed by a fire and the Linnean private collection was subsequently moved to a barn outside the town, and shortly afterwards to a single-room stone building close to his country house at Hammarby near Uppsala. This resulted in a physical separation between the two collections; the museum collection remained in the botanical garden of the university. Some material which needed special care (alcohol specimens) or ample storage space was moved from the private collection to the museum. 

In Hammarby the Linnean private collections suffered seriously from damp and the depredations by mice and insects. Carl von Linné's son (Carl Linnaeus) inherited the collections in 1778 and retained them until his own death in 1783. Shortly after Carl von Linné's death his son confirmed that mice had caused "horrible damage" to the plants and that also moths and mould had caused considerable damage. [ 156 ] He tried to rescue them from the neglect they had suffered during his father's later years, and also added further specimens. This last activity however reduced rather than augmented the scientific value of the original material. 

In 1784 the young medical student James Edward Smith purchased the entire specimen collection, library, manuscripts, and correspondence of Carl Linnaeus from his widow and daughter and transferred the collections to London. [ 157 ] [ 158 ] Not all material in Linné's private collection was transported to England. Thirty-three fish specimens preserved in alcohol were not sent and were later lost. [ 159 ] 

In London Smith tended to neglect the zoological parts of the collection; he added some specimens and also gave some specimens away. [ 160 ] Over the following centuries the Linnean collection in London suffered enormously at the hands of scientists who studied the collection, and in the process disturbed the original arrangement and labels, added specimens that did not belong to the original series and withdrew precious original type material. [ 156 ] 

Much material which had been intensively studied by Linné in his scientific career belonged to the collection of Queen Lovisa Ulrika (1720–1782) (in the Linnean publications referred to as "Museum Ludovicae Ulricae" or "M. L. U."). This collection was donated by her grandson King Gustav IV Adolf (1778–1837) to the museum in Uppsala in 1804. Another important collection in this respect was that of her husband King Adolf Fredrik (1710–1771) (in the Linnean sources known as "Museum Adolphi Friderici" or "Mus. Ad. Fr."), the wet parts (alcohol collection) of which were later donated to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences , and is today housed in the Swedish Museum of Natural History at Stockholm. The dry material was transferred to Uppsala. [ 154 ] 

# System of taxonomy 

Table of the Animal Kingdom ( Regnum Animale ) from the 1st edition of Systema Naturæ (1735) 

Main article: Linnaean taxonomy 

The establishment of universally accepted conventions for the naming of organisms was Linnaeus's main contribution to taxonomy—his work marks the starting point of consistent use of binomial nomenclature. [ 161 ] Another major contribution of his was the popularisation of using the Mars and Venus symbols (♂ and ♀) to denote sex within species. These symbols have now evolved into what we now know as the gender symbols [ 162 ] . During the 18th century expansion of natural history knowledge, Linnaeus also developed what became known as the Linnaean taxonomy ; the system of scientific classification now widely used in the biological sciences . A previous zoologist Rumphius (1627–1702) had more or less approximated the Linnaean system and his material contributed to the later development of the binomial scientific classification by Linnaeus. [ 163 ] 

The Linnaean system classified nature within a nested hierarchy , starting with three kingdoms . Kingdoms were divided into classes and they, in turn, into orders, and thence into genera ( singular: genus), which were divided into species ( singular: species). [ 164 ] Below the rank of species he sometimes recognised taxa of a lower (unnamed) rank ; these have since acquired standardised names such as variety in botany and subspecies in zoology. Modern taxonomy includes a rank of family between order and genus and a rank of phylum between kingdom and class that were not present in Linnaeus's original system. [ 165 ] 

Linnaeus's groupings were based upon shared physical characteristics, and not based upon differences. [ 165 ] Of his higher groupings, only those for animals are still in use, and the groupings themselves have been significantly changed since their conception, as have the principles behind them. Nevertheless, Linnaeus is credited with establishing the idea of a hierarchical structure of classification which is based upon observable characteristics and intended to reflect natural relationships. [ 161 ] [ 166 ] While the underlying details concerning what are considered to be scientifically valid "observable characteristics" have changed with expanding knowledge (for example, DNA sequencing , unavailable in Linnaeus's time, has proven to be a tool of considerable utility for classifying living organisms and establishing their evolutionary relationships ), the fundamental principle remains sound. 

# Human taxonomy 

Main article: Human taxonomy § History 

Linnaeus's system of taxonomy was especially noted as the first to include humans ( Homo ) taxonomically grouped with apes ( Simia ), under the header of Anthropomorpha .
German biologist Ernst Haeckel speaking in 1907 noted this as the "most important sign of Linnaeus's genius". [ 167 ] 

Linnaeus classified humans among the primates beginning with the first edition of Systema Naturae . [ 168 ] During his time at Hartekamp, he had the opportunity to examine several monkeys and noted similarities between them and man. [ 169 ] He pointed out both species basically have the same anatomy; except for speech, he found no other differences. [ 170 ] [ note 6 ] Thus he placed man and monkeys under the same category, Anthropomorpha , meaning "manlike". [ 171 ] This classification received criticism from other biologists such as Johan Gottschalk Wallerius , Jacob Theodor Klein and Johann Georg Gmelin on the ground that it is illogical to describe man as human-like. [ 172 ] In a letter to Gmelin from 1747, Linnaeus replied: [ 173 ] [ note 7 ] 

It does not please [you] that I've placed Man among the Anthropomorpha, perhaps because of the term 'with human form', [ note 8 ] but man learns to know himself. Let's not quibble over words. It will be the same to me whatever name we apply. But I seek from you and from the whole world a generic difference between man and simian that [follows] from the principles of Natural History. [ note 9 ] I absolutely know of none. If only someone might tell me a single one! If I would have called man a simian or vice versa, I would have brought together all the theologians against me. Perhaps I ought to have by virtue of the law of the discipline. 
Detail from the sixth edition of Systema Naturae (1748) describing Ant[h]ropomorpha with a division between Homo and Simia 

The theological concerns were twofold: first, putting man at the same level as monkeys or apes would lower the spiritually higher position that man was assumed to have in the great chain of being , and second, because the Bible says man was created in the image of God ( theomorphism ), if monkeys/apes and humans were not distinctly and separately designed, that would mean monkeys and apes were created in the image of God as well. This was something many could not accept. [ 174 ] The conflict between world views that was caused by asserting man was a type of animal would simmer for a century until the much greater, and still ongoing, creation–evolution controversy began in earnest with the publication of On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin in 1859. 

After such criticism, Linnaeus felt he needed to explain himself more clearly. The 10th edition of Systema Naturae introduced new terms, including Mammalia and Primates , the latter of which would replace Anthropomorpha [ 175 ] as well as giving humans the full binomial Homo sapiens . [ 176 ] The new classification received less criticism, but many natural historians still believed he had demoted humans from their former place of ruling over nature and not being a part of it. Linnaeus believed that man biologically belongs to the animal kingdom and had to be included in it. [ 177 ] In his book Dieta Naturalis , he said, "One should not vent one's wrath on animals, Theology decree that man has a soul and that the animals are mere 'automata mechanica', but I believe they would be better advised that animals have a soul and that the difference is of nobility." [ 178 ] 

Anthropomorpha , from the 1760 dissertation by C. E. Hoppius [ 179 ] 1. Troglodyta Bontii, 2. Lucifer Aldrovandi, 3. Satyrus Tulpii, 4. Pygmaeus Edwardi 

Linnaeus added a second species to the genus Homo in Systema Naturae based on a figure and description by Jacobus Bontius from a 1658 publication: Homo troglodytes ("caveman") [ 180 ] [ 181 ] and published a third in 1771: Homo lar . [ 182 ] Swedish historian Gunnar Broberg states that the new human species Linnaeus described were actually simians or native people clad in skins to frighten colonial settlers, whose appearance had been exaggerated in accounts to Linnaeus. [ 183 ] For Homo troglodytes Linnaeus asked the Swedish East India Company to search for one, but they did not find any signs of its existence. [ 184 ] Homo lar has since been reclassified as Hylobates lar , the lar gibbon . [ 185 ] 

See also: Race (human categorization) 

In the first edition of Systema Naturae , Linnaeus subdivided the human species into four varieties : "Europæus albesc[ens]" (whitish European), "Americanus rubesc[ens]" (reddish American), "Asiaticus fuscus" (tawny Asian) and "Africanus nigr[iculus]" (blackish African). [ 186 ] [ 187 ] In the tenth edition of Systema Naturae he further detailed phenotypical characteristics for each variety, based on the concept of the four temperaments from classical antiquity , [ 188 ] [ dubious – discuss ] and changed the description of Asians' skin tone to "luridus" (yellow). [ 189 ] While Linnaeus believed that these varieties resulted from environmental differences between the four known continents , [ 190 ] the Linnean Society acknowledges that his categorization's focus on skin color and later inclusion of cultural and behavioral traits cemented colonial stereotypes and provided the foundations for scientific racism . [ 191 ] Additionally, Linnaeus created a wastebasket taxon "monstrosus" for "wild and monstrous humans, unknown groups, and more or less abnormal people". [ 192 ] 

In 1959, W. T. Stearn designated Linnaeus to be the lectotype of H. sapiens . [ 193 ] [ 194 ] [ 195 ] 

# Influences and economic beliefs 

Statue on University of Chicago campus 

Linnaeus's applied science was inspired not only by the instrumental utilitarianism general to the early Enlightenment, but also by his adherence to the older economic doctrine of Cameralism . [ 196 ] Additionally, Linnaeus was a state interventionist. He supported tariffs, levies, export bounties, quotas, embargoes, navigation acts, subsidised investment capital, ceilings on wages, cash grants, state-licensed producer monopolies, and cartels. [ 197 ] 

# Commemoration 

1907 celebration in Råshult 

Main article: Commemoration of Carl Linnaeus 

Anniversaries of Linnaeus's birth, especially in centennial years, have been marked by major celebrations. [ 198 ] Linnaeus has appeared on numerous Swedish postage stamps and banknotes . [ 198 ] There are numerous statues of Linnaeus in countries around the world. The Linnean Society of London has awarded the Linnean Medal for excellence in botany or zoology since 1888. Following approval by the Riksdag of Sweden , Växjö University and Kalmar College merged on 1 January 2010 to become Linnaeus University . [ 199 ] Other things named after Linnaeus include the twinflower genus Linnaea , Linnaeosicyos (a monotypic genus in the family Cucurbitaceae ), [ 200 ] the crater Linné on the Earth's moon, a street in Cambridge, Massachusetts , and the cobalt sulfide mineral Linnaeite . 

# Commentary 

Philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau once wrote of Linnaeus, "I know no greater man on Earth." [ 201 ] Johann Wolfgang von Goethe wrote: "With the exception of William Shakespeare and Baruch Spinoza , I know no one among the no longer living who has influenced me more strongly." [ 201 ] Swedish author August Strindberg wrote: "Linnaeus was in reality a poet who happened to become a naturalist." [ 134 ] 

Linnaeus wrote a description of himself in his autobiography Egenhändiga anteckningar af Carl Linnæus om sig sjelf: med anmärkningar och tillägg , which was published by his student Adam Afzelius in 1823: 

Linnaeus was not big, not small, thin, brown-eyed, light, hasty, walked quickly, did everything promptly, could not stand lateness; was quickly moved, sensitive, worked continuously; could not spare himself. He enjoyed good food, drank good drinks; but was never inebriated by them. He cared little for appearance, believed that the man should embellish the clothes and not vice versa. He was certainly not argumentative, so he never answered those who wrote against him, and said: If I am wrong, I will not win and if I am right, I will be shown to be right as long as Nature exists. [ 202 ] 

Andrew Dickson White wrote in A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom (1896): 

Linnaeus ... was the most eminent naturalist of his time, a wide observer, a close thinker; but the atmosphere in which he lived and moved and had his being was saturated with biblical theology, and this permeated all his thinking. ... Toward the end of his life he timidly advanced the hypothesis that all the species of one genus constituted at the creation one species; and from the last edition of his Systema Naturæ he quietly left out the strongly orthodox statement of the fixity of each species, which he had insisted upon in his earlier works. ... warnings came speedily both from the Catholic and Protestant sides. [ 203 ] 

The mathematical PageRank algorithm, applied to 24 multilingual Wikipedia editions in 2014, published in PLOS ONE in 2015, placed Carl Linnaeus at the top historical figure, above Jesus , Aristotle , Napoleon , and Adolf Hitler (in that order). [ 204 ] [ 205 ] 

In the 21st century, Linnæus's taxonomy of human "races" has been criticized. Some claim that Linnæus was one of the forebears of the modern pseudoscientific notion of scientific racism , while others hold the view that while his classification was stereotyped, it did not imply that certain human "races" were superior to others.

- ^ Frängsmyr et al. (1983) , p. 167, quotes Linnaeus explaining the real difference would necessarily be absent from his classification system, as it was not a morphological characteristic: "I well know what a splendidly great difference there is [between] a man and a bestia [literally, "beast"; that is, a non-human animal] when I look at them from a point of view of morality . Man is the animal which the Creator has seen fit to honor with such a magnificent mind and has condescended to adopt as his favorite and for which he has prepared a nobler life" . See also books.google.com in which Linnaeus cites the significant capacity to reason as the distinguishing characteristic of humans.

- ^ Others who followed were more inclined to give humans a special place in classification; Johann Friedrich Blumenbach in the first edition of his Manual of Natural History (1779), proposed that the primates be divided into the Quadrumana (four-handed, i.e. apes and monkeys) and Bimana (two-handed, i.e. humans). This distinction was taken up by other naturalists, most notably Georges Cuvier . Some elevated the distinction to the level of order . However, the many affinities between humans and other primates—and especially the great apes—made it clear that the distinction made no scientific sense. Charles Darwin wrote, in The Descent of Man in 1871: 

The greater number of naturalists who have taken into consideration the whole structure of man, including his mental faculties, have followed Blumenbach and Cuvier , and have placed man in a separate Order, under the title of the Bimana, and therefore on an equality with the orders of the Quadrumana, Carnivora, etc. Recently many of our best naturalists have recurred to the view first propounded by Linnaeus, so remarkable for his sagacity, and have placed man in the same Order with the Quadrumana, under the title of the Primates. The justice of this conclusion will be admitted: for in the first place, we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain in man, and that the strongly marked differences between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana (lately insisted upon by Bischoff , Aeby , and others) apparently follow from their differently developed brains. In the second place, we must remember that nearly all the other and more important differences between man and the Quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature, and relate chiefly to the erect position of man; such as the structure of his hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of his spine, and the position of his head.

Book by Carl Linnaeus 

For an overview of the book in all editions, see Systema Naturae . 
Title page of the 10th edition of Systema Naturae 

The 10th edition of Systema Naturae (Latin; the English title is A General System of Nature ) is a book written by Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus and published in two volumes in 1758 and 1759, which marks the starting point of zoological nomenclature . In it, Linnaeus introduced binomial nomenclature for animals , something he had already done for plants in his 1753 publication of Species Plantarum . 

# Starting point 
[ edit ] 

Before 1758, most biological catalogues had used polynomial names for the taxa included, including earlier editions of Systema Naturae . The first work to consistently apply binomial nomenclature across the animal kingdom was the 10th edition of Systema Naturae . The International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature therefore chose 1 January 1758 as the "starting point" for zoological nomenclature and asserted that the 10th edition of Systema Naturae was to be treated as if published on that date. [ 1 ] Names published before that date are unavailable, even if they would otherwise satisfy the rules. The only work which takes priority over the 10th edition is Carl Alexander Clerck 's Svenska Spindlar or Aranei Suecici , which was published in 1757, but is also to be treated as if published on January 1, 1758. [ 1 ]

During Linnaeus' lifetime, Systema Naturae was under continuous revision. Progress was incorporated into new and ever-expanding editions; for example, in his 1st edition (1735), whales and manatees were originally classified as species of fish (as was thought to be the case then). In the 10th edition, they were both moved into the mammal class. [ 2 ] 

# Animals 
[ edit ] 

The animal kingdom (as described by Linnaeus): "Animals enjoy sensation by means of a living organization, animated by a medullary substance; perception by nerves; and motion by the exertion of the will. They have members for the different purposes of life; organs for their different senses; and faculties (or powers) for the application of their different perceptions. They all originate from an egg. Their external and internal structure; their comparative anatomy, habits, instincts, and various relations to each other, are detailed in authors who professedly treat on their subjects." [ 3 ] 

The list has been broken down into the original six classes Linnaeus described for animals; Mammalia , Aves , Amphibia , Pisces , Insecta , and Vermes . These classes were ultimately created by studying the internal anatomy, as seen in his key: [ 3 ] 

- Heart with two auricles, two ventricles. Warm, red blood 
- Viviparous: Mammalia 
- Oviparous: Aves 
- Heart with one auricle, one ventricle. Cold, red blood 
- Lungs voluntary: Amphibia 
- External gills: Pisces 
- Heart with one auricle, no ventricles. Cold, pus-like blood 
- Have antennae: Insecta 
- Have tentacles: Vermes 

By current standards Pisces and Vermes are informal groupings, Insecta also contained arachnids and crustaceans , and one order of Amphibia comprised sharks , lampreys , and sturgeons . 

# Mammalia 
[ edit ] 

Main article: Mammalia in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae 
The Barbary macaque was included in the 10th edition as Simia sylvanus . 

Linnaeus described mammals as: "Animals that suckle their young by means of lactiferous teats. In external and internal structure they resemble man: most of them are quadrupeds; and with man, their natural enemy, inhabit the surface of the Earth. The largest, though fewest in number, inhabit the ocean." [ 3 ] 

Linnaeus divided the mammals based upon the number, situation, and structure of their teeth, into the following orders and genera: 

- Primates : Homo ( humans ), Simia ( monkeys and apes ), Lemur ( lemurs and colugos ) and Vespertilio ( bats ) 
- Bruta : Elephas ( elephants ), Trichechus ( manatees ), Bradypus ( sloths ), Myrmecophaga ( anteaters ) and Manis ( pangolins ) 
- Ferae : Phoca ( seals ), Canis ( dogs and hyenas ), Felis ( cats ), Viverra ( mongooses and civets ), Mustela ( weasels and kin) and Ursus ( bears ) 
- Bestiae : Sus ( pigs ), Dasypus ( armadillos ), Erinaceus ( hedgehogs ), Talpa ( moles ), Sorex ( shrews ) and Didelphis ( opossums )

# Aves 
[ edit ] 

Main article: Aves in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae 
The snowy owl was included in the 10th edition as Strix scandiaca . 

Linnaeus described birds as: "A beautiful and cheerful portion of created nature consisting of animals having a body covered with feathers and down; protracted and naked jaws (the beak), two wings formed for flight, and two feet. They are areal, vocal, swift and light, and destitute of external ears, lips, teeth, scrotum, womb, bladder, epiglottis, corpus callosum and its arch, and diaphragm." [ 3 ] 

Linnaeus divided the birds based upon the characters of the bill and feet, into the following 6 orders and 63 genera:

# Amphibia 
[ edit ] 

Main article: Amphibia in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae 
The common frog was included in the 10th edition as Rana temporaria . 

Linnaeus described his "Amphibia" (comprising reptiles and amphibians ) as: "Animals that are distinguished by a body cold and generally naked; stern and expressive countenance; harsh voice; mostly lurid color; filthy odor; a few are furnished with a horrid poison; all have cartilaginous bones, slow circulation, exquisite sight and hearing, large pulmonary vessels, lobate liver, oblong thick stomach, and cystic, hepatic, and pancreatic ducts: they are deficient in diaphragm, do not transpire (sweat), can live a long time without food, are tenacious of life, and have the power of reproducing parts which have been destroyed or lost; some undergo a metamorphosis; some cast (shed) their skin; some appear to live promiscuously on land or in the water, and some are torpid during the winter." [ 3 ] 

Linnaeus divided the amphibians based upon the limb structures and the way they breathed, into the following orders and genera: [ 4 ] 

- Reptiles : Testudo ( turtles and tortoises ), Draco ( gliding lizards ), Lacerta ( terrestrial lizards , salamanders , and crocodilians ) and Rana ( frogs and toads )

Main article: Pisces in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae 
The butterfly blenny was included in the 10th edition as Blennius ocellatus . 

Linnaeus described fish as: "Always inhabiting the waters; are swift in their motion and voracious in their appetites. They breathe by means of gills, which are generally united by a bony arch; swim by means of radiate fins, and are mostly covered over with cartilaginous scales. Besides the parts they have in common with other animals, they are furnished with a nictitant membrane, and most of them with a swim-bladder, by the contraction or dilatation of which, they can raise or sink themselves in their element at pleasure." [ 3 ] 

Linnaeus divided the fishes based upon the position of the ventral and pectoral fins, into the following orders and genera: [ 3 ] 

- Apodes : Muraena ( eels ), Gymnotus ( electric knifefishes ), Trichiurus ( cutlassfishes ), Anarhichas ( wolffishes ), Ammodytes ( sand eels ), Stromateus ( butterfishes ) and Xiphias ( swordfishes )

# Insecta 
[ edit ] 

Main article: Insecta in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae 
Crustaceans such as the water flea Monoculus pulex (now Daphnia pulex ) were included in Linnaeus' Insecta. Linnaeus gave the name Cicada septendecim to an insect whose adult appears once in 17 years. 

Linnaeus described his "Insecta" (comprising all arthropods , including insects , crustaceans , arachnids and others) as: "A very numerous and various class consisting of small animals, breathing through lateral spiracles, armed on all sides with a bony skin, or covered with hair; furnished with many feet, and moveable antennae (or horns), which project from the head, and are the probable instruments of sensation." [ 5 ]

# Vermes 
[ edit ] 

Main article: Vermes in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae 
The common cuttlefish was named Sepia officinalis in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae . 

Linnaeus described his "Vermes" as: "Animals of slow motion, soft substance, able to increase their bulk and restore parts which have been destroyed, extremely tenacious of life, and the inhabitants of moist places. Many of them are without a distinct head, and most of them without feet. They are principally distinguished by their tentacles (or feelers). By the Ancients they were not improperly called imperfect animals, as being destitute of ears, nose, head, eyes and legs; and are therefore totally distinct from Insects." [ 7 ] 

Linnaeus divided the "Vermes" based upon the structure of the body, into the following orders and genera: [ 7 ] 

- Intestina : Gordius ( horsehair worms ), Furia , Lumbricus ( earthworms ), Ascaris ( giant intestinal roundworms ), Fasciola ( liver flukes ), Hirudo ( leeches ), Myxine ( hagfishes ), Teredo ( shipworms )

# Plants 
[ edit ] 

The second volume, published in 1759, detailed the kingdom Plantae, in which Linnaeus included true plants , as well as fungi , algae and lichens . In addition to repeating the species he had previously listed in his Species Plantarum (1753), and those published in the intervening period, Linnaeus described several hundred new plant species. The species from Species Plantarum were numbered sequentially, while the new species were labelled with letters. [ 8 ] Many were sent to Linnaeus by his correspondents overseas, including Johannes Burman and David de Gorter in South Africa , Patrick Browne , Philip Miller and John Ellis in America, Jean-François Séguier , Carlo Allioni and Casimir Christoph Schmidel in the Alps , Gorter and Johann Ernst Hebenstreit in the Orient, and François Boissier de Sauvages de Lacroix , Gerard and Barnadet Gabriel across Europe.

Scientific name that also applies to a taxon 

This article may be confusing or unclear to readers . Please help clarify the article . There might be a discussion about this on the talk page . ( August 2020 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) 

Nerita bernhardi (left), described by Lovell Augustus Reeve in 1855, was later determined to be a junior subjective synonym to Nerita funiculata (right), which had already been described five years earlier by Karl Theodor Menke . 

In taxonomy , a synonym is one of two or more scientific names that apply to the same taxon . [ 1 ] The botanical and zoological codes of nomenclature treat the concept of synonymy differently. 

- In botanical nomenclature , a synonym is a scientific name that applies to a taxon that now goes by a different scientific name. [ 2 ] For example, Linnaeus was the first to give a scientific name (under the currently used system of scientific nomenclature) to the Norway spruce, which he called Pinus abies . This name is no longer in use, so it is now a synonym of the current scientific name, Picea abies . 
- In zoology, moving a species from one genus to another results in a different binomen , but the name is considered an alternative combination rather than a synonym. The concept of synonymy in zoology is reserved for two names at the same rank that refers to a taxon at that rank – for example, the name Papilio prorsa Linnaeus, 1758 is a junior synonym of Papilio levana Linnaeus, 1758 , being names for different seasonal forms of the species now referred to as Araschnia levana (Linnaeus, 1758) , the map butterfly. However, Araschnia levana is not a synonym of Papilio levana in the taxonomic sense employed by the Zoological code. [ 3 ] 

Unlike synonyms in other contexts, in taxonomy a synonym is not interchangeable with the name of which it is a synonym. In taxonomy, synonyms are not equals, but have a different status. For any taxon with a particular circumscription , position, and rank, only one scientific name is considered to be the correct one at any given time (this correct name is to be determined by applying the relevant code of nomenclature ). A synonym cannot exist in isolation: it is always an alternative to a different scientific name. Given that the correct name of a taxon depends on the taxonomic viewpoint used (resulting in a particular circumscription, position and rank) a name that is one taxonomist's synonym may be another taxonomist's correct name (and vice versa ). 

Synonyms may arise whenever the same taxon is described and named more than once independently. They may also arise when existing taxa are changed, as when two taxa are joined to become one, a species is moved to a different genus, a variety is moved to a different species, etc. Synonyms also come about when the codes of nomenclature change, so that older names are no longer acceptable; for example, Erica herbacea L. has been rejected in favour of the conserved name of Erica carnea L. and is thus its synonym. [ 4 ] 

# General usage 
[ edit ] 

To the general user of scientific names, in fields such as agriculture, horticulture, ecology, general science, etc., a synonym is a name that was previously used as the correct scientific name (in handbooks and similar sources) but which has been displaced by another scientific name, which is now regarded as correct. Thus Oxford Dictionaries Online defines the term as "a taxonomic name which has the same application as another, especially one which has been superseded and is no longer valid". [ 5 ] In handbooks and general texts, it is useful to have synonyms mentioned as such after the current scientific name, so as to avoid confusion. For example, if the much-advertised name change should go through and the scientific name of the fruit fly were changed to Sophophora melanogaster , it would be very helpful if any mention of this name was accompanied by "(syn. Drosophila melanogaster )". Synonyms used in this way may not always meet the strict definitions of the term "synonym" in the formal rules of nomenclature which govern scientific names (see below) . 

Changes of scientific name have two causes: they may be taxonomic or nomenclatural. [ 1 ] A name change may be caused by changes in the circumscription, position or rank of a taxon, representing a change in taxonomic, scientific insight (as would be the case for the fruit fly, mentioned above). A name change may be due to purely nomenclatural reasons, that is, based on the rules of nomenclature; [ 1 ] as for example when an older name is (re)discovered which has priority over the current name. Speaking in general, name changes for nomenclatural reasons have become less frequent over time as the rules of nomenclature allow for names to be conserved, so as to promote stability of scientific names. 

# Zoology 
[ edit ] 

Further information: Valid name (zoology) 

In zoological nomenclature, codified in the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature , synonyms are different scientific names of the same taxonomic rank that pertain to that same taxon . For example, a particular species could, over time, have had two or more species-rank names published for it, while the same is applicable at higher ranks such as genera, families, orders, etc. In each case, the earliest published name is called the senior synonym , while the later name is the junior synonym . In the case where two names for the same taxon have been published simultaneously, the valid name is selected according to the principle of the first reviser such that, for example, of the names Strix scandiaca and Strix noctua (Aves), both published by Linnaeus in the same work at the same date for the taxon now determined to be the snowy owl , the epithet scandiaca has been selected as the valid name, with noctua becoming the junior synonym. (Incidentally, this species has since been reclassified and currently resides in the genus Bubo , as Bubo scandiacus [ 6 ] ). 

One basic principle of zoological nomenclature is that the earliest correctly published (and thus available ) name, the senior synonym, by default takes precedence in naming rights and therefore, unless other restrictions interfere, must be used for the taxon. However, junior synonyms are still important to document, because if the earliest name cannot be used (for example, because the same spelling had previously been used for a name established for another taxon), then the next available junior synonym must be used for the taxon. For other purposes, if a researcher is interested in consulting or compiling all currently known information regarding a taxon, some of this (including species descriptions, distribution, ecology and more) may well have been published under names now regarded as outdated (i.e., synonyms) and so it is again useful to know a list of historic synonyms which may have been used for a given current (valid) taxon name. 

Objective synonyms refer to taxa with the same type and same rank (more or less the same taxon, although circumscription may vary, even widely). This may be species-group taxa of the same rank with the same type specimen , genus-group taxa of the same rank with the same type species or if their type species are themselves objective synonyms, of family-group taxa with the same type genus, etc. [ 7 ] 

In the case of subjective synonyms , there is no such shared type, so the synonymy is open to taxonomic judgement, [ 8 ] meaning that there is room for debate: one researcher might consider the two (or more) types to refer to one and the same taxon, another might consider them to belong to different taxa. For example, John Edward Gray published the name Antilocapra anteflexa in 1855 for a species of pronghorn , based on a pair of horns. However, it is now commonly accepted that his specimen was an unusual individual of the species Antilocapra americana published by George Ord in 1815. Ord's name thus takes precedence, with Antilocapra anteflexa being a junior subjective synonym. 

Objective synonyms are common at the rank of genera, because for various reasons two genera may contain the same type species; these are objective synonyms. [ 9 ] In many cases researchers established new generic names because they thought this was necessary or did not know that others had previously established another genus for the same group of species. An example is the genus Pomatia Beck, 1837, [ 10 ] which was established for a group of terrestrial snails containing as its type species the Burgundy or Roman snail Helix pomatia —since Helix pomatia was already the type species for the genus Helix Linnaeus, 1758, the genus Pomatia was an objective synonym (and useless). On the same occasion, Helix is also a synonym of Pomatia , but it is older and so it has precedence. 

At the species level, subjective synonyms are common because of an unexpectedly large range of variation in a species, or simple ignorance about an earlier description, may lead a biologist to describe a newly discovered specimen as a new species. A common reason for objective synonyms at this level is the creation of a replacement name. 

A junior synonym can be given precedence over a senior synonym, [ 11 ] primarily when the senior name has not been used since 1899, and the junior name is in common use. The older name may be declared to be a nomen oblitum , and the junior name declared a nomen protectum . This rule exists primarily to prevent the confusion that would result if a well-known name, with a large accompanying body of literature, were to be replaced by a completely unfamiliar name. An example is the European land snail Petasina edentula ( Draparnaud , 1805). In 2002, researchers found that an older name Helix depilata Draparnaud, 1801 referred to the same species, but this name had never been used after 1899 and was fixed as a nomen oblitum under this rule by Falkner et al. 2002. [ 12 ] 

Such a reversal of precedence is also possible if the senior synonym was established after 1900, but only if the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) approves an application. (Here the C in ICZN stands for Commission, not Code as it does at the beginning of § Zoology . The two are related, with only one word difference between their names.) For example, the scientific name of the red imported fire ant , Solenopsis invicta was published by Buren in 1972, who did not know that this species was first named Solenopsis saevissima wagneri by Santschi in 1916; as there were thousands of publications using the name invicta before anyone discovered the synonymy, the ICZN, in 2001, ruled that invicta would be given precedence over wagneri . 

To qualify as a synonym in zoology, a name must be properly published in accordance with the rules. Manuscript names and names that were mentioned without any description ( nomina nuda ) are not considered as synonyms in zoological nomenclature. 

# Botany 
[ edit ] 

In botanical nomenclature , a synonym is a name that is not correct for the circumscription , position, and rank of the taxon as considered in the particular botanical publication. It is always "a synonym of the correct scientific name", but which name is correct depends on the taxonomic opinion of the author. In botany the various kinds of synonyms are: 

- Homotypic , or nomenclatural, synonyms (sometimes indicated by ≡ ) have the same type (specimen) and the same taxonomic rank . The Linnaean name Pinus abies L. has the same type as Picea abies (L.) H.Karst. When Picea is taken to be the correct genus for this species (there is almost complete consensus on that), Pinus abies is a homotypic synonym of Picea abies . However, if the species were considered to belong to Pinus (now unlikely) the relationship would be reversed and Picea abies would become a homotypic synonym of Pinus abies . A homotypic synonym need not share an epithet or name with the correct name; what matters is that it shares the type. For example, the name Taraxacum officinale for a species of dandelion has the same type as Leontodon taraxacum L. The latter is a homotypic synonym of Taraxacum officinale F.H.Wigg. 
- Heterotypic , or taxonomic, synonyms (sometimes indicated by =) have different types. Some botanists split the common dandelion into many, quite restricted species. The name of each such species has its own type. When the common dandelion is regarded as including all those small species, the names of all those species are heterotypic synonyms of Taraxacum officinale F.H.Wigg. Reducing a taxon to a heterotypic synonym is termed "to sink in synonymy" or "as synonym". 

In botany, although a synonym must be a formally accepted scientific name (a validly published name): a listing of "synonyms", a "synonymy", often contains designations that for some reason did not make it as a formal name, such as manuscript names, or even misidentifications (although it is now the usual practice to list misidentifications separately [ 13 ] ). 

# Comparison between zoology and botany 
[ edit ] 

Although the basic principles are fairly similar, the treatment of synonyms in botanical nomenclature differs in detail and terminology from zoological nomenclature, where the correct name is included among synonyms, although as first among equals it is the "senior synonym": 

- Synonyms in botany are equivalent to "junior synonyms" in zoology. 
- The homotypic or nomenclatural synonyms in botany are equivalent to "objective synonyms" in zoology. 
- The heterotypic or taxonomic synonyms in botany are equivalent to "subjective synonyms" in zoology. 
- If the name of a species changes solely on account of its allocation to a new genus ("new combinations"), in botany this is regarded as creating a synonym in the case of the original or previous combination but not in zoology (where the fundamental nomenclatural unit is regarded as the species epithet, not the binomen, and this has generally not changed). Nevertheless, in popular usage, previous or alternative/non current combinations are frequently listed as synonyms in zoology as well as in botany. 

# Practical applications 
[ edit ] 

Scientific papers may include lists of taxa, synonymizing existing taxa and (in some cases) listing references to them. 

The status of a synonym may be indicated by symbols, as for instance in a system proposed for use in paleontology by Rudolf Richter. In that system a v before the year would indicate that the authors have inspected the original material; a . that they take on the responsibility for the act of synonymizing the taxa. [ 14 ] 

The accurate use of scientific names, including synonyms, is crucial in biomedical and pharmacological research involving plants. Failure to use correct botanical nomenclature can lead to ambiguity, hinder reproducibility of results, and potentially cause errors in medicine. Best practices for publication suggest that researchers should provide the currently accepted binomial with author citation, relevant synonyms, and the accepted family name according to the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group III classification. This practice ensures clear communication, allows proper linking of research to existing literature, and provides insight into phylogenetic relationships that may be relevant to shared chemical constituents or physiological effects. Online databases now make it easy for researchers to access correct nomenclature and synonymy information for plant species. [ 15 ] 

# Other usage 
[ edit ] 

The traditional concept of synonymy is often expanded in taxonomic literature to include pro parte (or "for part") synonyms. These are caused by splits and circumscriptional changes. They are usually indicated by the abbreviation "p.p." [ 16 ] For example: 

- When Dandy described Galium tricornutum , he cited G. tricorne Stokes (1787) pro parte as a synonym, but explicitly excluded the type (specimen) of G. tricorne from the new species G. tricornutum . Thus G. tricorne was subdivided. 
- The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group 's summary of plant classification states that family Verbenaceae "are much reduced compared to a decade or so ago, and many genera have been placed in Lamiaceae ", but Avicennia , which was once included in Verbenaceae has been moved to Acanthaceae . Thus, it could be said that Verbenaceae pro parte is a synonym of Acanthaceae, and Verbenaceae pro parte is also a synonym of Lamiaceae. However, this terminology is rarely used because it is clearer to reserve the term "pro parte" for situations that divide a taxon that includes the type from one that does not.
